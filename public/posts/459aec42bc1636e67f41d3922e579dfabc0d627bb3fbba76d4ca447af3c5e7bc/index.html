I saw a fansign video and people were all only screaming Hao and Ricky's name with a little yujin. And he kept trying to do heart or whatever with Hao and tried to provide fanservice for fans which made him look uncomfy because I guess there weren't many allins for him to do fanservice for. Probably why he was clingy to Hao there because he didn't have many allins to do fanservice for and so he went on to give fanservice for the shippers. And I saw a weibo post saying that rosins were being rude and were screaming Hao's name during every members parts and ments that some thought it was for them. I also saw them say that gunwook said the crowd is so loud today thank you but then rosins next to her were mocking like"who was cheering you, it was only for our hao". There was definitely more rosins in the crowd probably why Hao didn't want to do as many ship fanservice with Hanbin. These two are just so serious about providing fanservice</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
