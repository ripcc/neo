South Korean’s leader is something akin to Andrew Tate. That’s going to sound ridiculous but he’s very misogynistic, pushes for traditional family values, and is staunchly against anything progressive. He’s been deteriorating the safeguard mechanisms for democracy in South Korea since he was elected. 2. A lot of political scientist expected South Korea to get to this point. Even outside the messed up gender dynamic and insane hatred, a few months back, during a progressive protest, a progressive politician stepped in front of the police to stop them from beating up the protestors. Instead, the police began attacking him. That’s a bad sign when military or police feel comfortable enough attacking a known progressive politician when he wasn’t attacking them whatsoever. 3. Now, what to expect? South Korea has paused soldiers from being released from their service. I fully expect them to forcibly draft more men if they need it. Forced conscriptions. No one is safe, ranging from doctors to news anchors to kpop idols - if things get worse (and they are looking like it) - and if big protests happen, they will be drafted. Anyone on a work visa for non essential jobs might be kicked out or put under diplomatic protection, including idols. The only thing that might prevent all this - and yes I’m being fr - is American pressure or international sanctions on their stuff, which is also unlikely considering their oligarchies and chaebol families and technological essentials. It’s going to be a very turbulent time for South Korea. Keep in mind, although kpop does have a significant positive impact on gdp, it’s a luxury to have. Especially since it’s been more westernized and can be interpreted as informing the youth of western culture - things the leader is against.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
