You're a piece of shit and I just know you're a koreaboo allin who thinks your fav deserves things just because he's korean. Plenty of foreigner idols like yuqi and jackson were promoted and the people who are being promoted on variety shows aren't all that either. This is actually grossing me out. It's crazy how you guys can twist zh not having a korean schedule for half a year into this. And fyi gp dgaf about any members of zb1 like you're implying and zhang hao has one of the most kfans???? You really think people are tuning in for gyuvin? and yet he's there isn't he. Fyi nobody was mad he has a schedule. You guys just perpetuate really gross xenophobia when you talk about him. You're literally proving my fucking point fuck you.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
