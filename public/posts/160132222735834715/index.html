The account actually looks sus imho. the bibigo kr Instagram is their only social listed. the account being created june 2024 and only started posting Feb this year with who made this post and following bunch of hanbin fans while bibigo usa is following influencers, doctors, restaurants and businesses like a proper business account is kinda the takeaway</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
