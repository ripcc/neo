HE WOKE UP AT FUCKING 4AM TO BUY SOME FUCKING VITAMINS JUST CUS HE WANTED TO OMFG AND HE SAID HOW DOING STUFF WHEN HE WANTS FEELS FREE-ING ðŸ˜­ and then dumb ass riyangis blaming gyuvin like bitch it aint gyuvins fault he put in the extra effort to wake up early to book a slot, if ricky really felt like it and wanted to he could easily set an alarm, book the slot and then go back to bed but he's not the planner type and like i said he's clearly the 'when i feel like it' type and thats fucking okay.....</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
