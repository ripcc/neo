First, gunwook was not even the one who brings him up and watched his entire match. Second, the same member who watched that match got clearer proof he was (or is still, idt saying 'sorry' would make you stop being a hannam especially when you slip for the second time after saying sorry for the first) a hannam, caught not once but twice using terms only known to hannams but looks like he is either that irrelevant to the point people don't really care about him or his fans are in denial because you guys keep looking at him with rosetinted glass. Or maybe his fans just as stupid as him there is nothing inside those small heads?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Also gyv just got lucky enough to get awarded the queer pass from intl zroses he doesn't get the frat boy politics like gwk does</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
