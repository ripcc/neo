The shoot was something important ig since he mentioned having his makeup done for it and talking about how he asked the makeup to be gentle. But they definitely could have let him skip the practice like he said he was told not to work out or anything yet he still had to go to practice. Also he mentioned not being given stitches because they are flying out to Japan this week and it could cause complications if the stitches bury due to the pressure so he was fr just bleeding free like maybe I sympathise a bit more because I had mine out recently but I was stuck in bed for 2 days with the worst migraine after I had mine taken out and I think I have quite a high pain tolerance so I canâ€™t imagine having to dance for hours on top of it</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
