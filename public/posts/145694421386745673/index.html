I know that they have zbtv and the trend now within idol agencies is to produce their own original content for their yt but I want moreeeðŸ˜« zb1 have great variety skills and we need to see that more no group live no variety program no nothing WHYYYY</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
