I'd hate to think what everyone will say once they saw his cn gf stan repos gets translated because its actually crazier than haobin repos. Like it's making haobin be friends with him reaaally upping the gf Stan fanservice. But I think this just shows that he's a kpop pstan though and through since he knows how to accommodate all lmao</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
