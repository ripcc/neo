She obviously didn't want Yujin and Gunwook in ZB1. LOL, when there was a horrible encore from ZB1, she purposefully chose the 21st remark to shade Yujin above other top comments concerning Ricky's vocal break, and everyone knows she always translates negative articles about Gunwook. Surprisingly, she translated an article with 21 likes and 14 comments regarding Yuna and the chemistry of the TBZ members while omitting Yujin.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I'm pretty sure someone said it seemed like her or one of the admins picks was taerae last year but I could be misremembering I forget what her ethnicity is tho I only know her face</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
