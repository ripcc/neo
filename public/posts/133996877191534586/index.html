And they hate another update account, and always shit on them and now it seems like both of them are in a mutual block. And the main reason why they hate them is because the other update account is small but recently they got a lot of hit tweets. So they call them a hag, their translation is not accurate, that they don't have money to go watch zb1 live etc etc. And this person also likes many bgs apart from zb1 like bnd, riize, nct dream (tbh they like every big4 bgs) and they even have separate fanaccount for other groups too. Even though I follow them, I think they are the problem for beefing with another account, it seems like she blocked the other account first and got blocked back....</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
