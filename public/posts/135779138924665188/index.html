Also unless priv tweets are genuinely something harmful or outright psychotic I never understand why people share priv tweets they could just ignore. Like there are many shippers of many diffrent duos who probably act exactly the same on their priv accounts.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
