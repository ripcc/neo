Team Wang collaborated with fusion before and Fusion's endorsers are all big names in C-ent but the executives wanted Hao as their ambassador. Not just someone modeling or attending events but someone who represent the brand and it's huge</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
