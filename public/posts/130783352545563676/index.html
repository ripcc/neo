I have been looking into a few aespa videos, and her korean is worse than Ricky and hao(not saying that's bad), and she is a bit introverted. I feel like she still doesn't feel as comfortable around koreans except for the aespa members. And also, I used to be a huge winter stan before looking at their group contents other than performances. But ningning is my favorite now. Also is it okay to say here, I feel like everyone here loves winter, I used to and still think she is the best performer in the group but I don't like her personality at all in some of their group contents.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
