I can't believe I missed out on this tea for so long.
"the rich rich ones are the batshit crazy ones with unlimited $$$ who can stay in korea for as long as they want and book prestige class with them on the plane. those are the batshit crazy ones because they genuinely believe they got a chance with them. they camp outside their dorms and hotels and they dress up. for the most part from what i know only hao has the batshit crazy ssgs even when it comes to all of zb1." I laughed so hard at this ngl, what is it about hao that attracts clinically insane people? I guess it has its perks cause his fans are willing to spend a shit ton of money and time on his solo projects, but then you have the dark side with asylum patients like the batshit crazy ssngs and rabid akgaes. I need Blank to come back and give us new updates soon.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
