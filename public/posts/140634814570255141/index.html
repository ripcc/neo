I wear a good amount of makeup and I'd never want my 3am face on cameras so I doubt they leave it on</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140631244177363638 class=replyLink>/+r/140631244177363638</a>They redo it again if the pre recording is by midnight or the day before but don't if it is during day time on the day of broadcast. Sometimes you can even notice a slight difference in makeup in live broadcast compared to the one in the performance if the pre recording was done early.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
