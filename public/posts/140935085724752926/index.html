I rlly liked Ricky and Matthew's too I already forgot what half the group was wearing so I can't rmbr yjns but the fits weren't too bad with the stage it looked more jarring in the mcountdown video. I'm just wondering if this has a choreo or not I was watching the fancam and I could see gwk dancing but maybe it's not to the full song idk</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140900469324339126 class=replyLink>/+r/140900469324339126</a>Omg not a gunwook fan but I thought he looked gorggg like he was mogging in the group pic.
