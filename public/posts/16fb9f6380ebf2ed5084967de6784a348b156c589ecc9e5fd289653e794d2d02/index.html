And they are on stage in front of fans, there is nothing wrong with fanservice and their private relationship and what they do for fans is different. And Hanbin looked really uncomfortable when there weren't people calling for him at the fansign, he looked like he wanted to pose for fans but couldn't find enough fans to pose for and therefore just posed with Hao. Do you think they'd think about showing off their relationship in a fansign or concert in front of fans than to make the fans happy??? Them being in a relationship or not has nothing to do with what they do on stage.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
