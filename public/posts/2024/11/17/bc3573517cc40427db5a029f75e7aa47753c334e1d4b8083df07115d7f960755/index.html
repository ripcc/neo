<small>2024-11-17 15:29:59</small></header><p>This is just copy pasted Twitter translation they're saying it's unfair that riize and bnd are nominated for rookie awards and zb1 aren't when they're all 1 year old rookies "No, what the fuck, it's called the KGMA Rookie of the Year Rise, so I went in and thought, but in the middle of this, Zero Base One was excluded from the nominations. What the fuck, what the heck, if a rookie of the year award wins a grand slam in 23, they're excluded from the rookie of the year award in 24? You're including a group that debuted in May 23, but then excluding the group in July because they achieved a grand slam, and you're sitting here fucking there, I should laugh or cry"</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
