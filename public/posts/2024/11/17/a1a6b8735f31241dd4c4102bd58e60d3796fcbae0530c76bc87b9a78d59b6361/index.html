I did know another crosin akgae tho that didn't think they were but she also believed the Hao playboy with women rumours ðŸ˜­when she got the confirmation from someone close to Hao that he was definitely gay she crashed out but also accepted it because him potentially messing with his bad mate on the low is way better than him being a gross fuckboy I suddenly remembered talking to these two people because of this, it was funny lol</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I've heard this a lot but you'd be surprised just how much krosins don't think he's gay I used to space with a bunch of random ones back in the day and they'd scream at me for calling hao gay ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
