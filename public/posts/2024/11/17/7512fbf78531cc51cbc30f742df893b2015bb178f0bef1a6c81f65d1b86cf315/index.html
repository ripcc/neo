Saying that they are dating is easier than whatever they have going on. I know that the fans, who come from the shipping community label everything as dating. I get why they would think so but I still wouldnt label the relationship Zhang Hao and Sung Hanbin have as just boyfriends. Everything would actually be easier, if they WERE dating</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
