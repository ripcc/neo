I don't know it's 50/50 because I usually judge it based off their activeness, if they're overly active from their usual it's either they're really happy/ inspired and just want to express their thanks or they're lowkey depressed and using social media/ lives to distract themselves from their feelings and i've been feeling the latter with matt 😭😭😭 But what about you? why do you feel this way 👀</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
