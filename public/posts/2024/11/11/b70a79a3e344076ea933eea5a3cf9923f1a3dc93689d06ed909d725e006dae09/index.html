Sure the realistic odds is that they might not be as big as zb1 is but I’d take him getting more lines, variety appearances, and industry connections over a mama award anyday. His vocals have been getting increasingly better and I need a solo track from him eventually. ZB1 would never let him do that or prioritize him enough. Plus he’s the only member in the group (and one of the only idols in all of kpop) that could actually handle dancing, rapping, and singing all in a solo, plus he could very well write his own stuff. (Hanbin solos argue with a wall if you think his rapping was even close to being good and if his pen game is even a tenth of Gunwook’s). Gunwook has so much potential and the company has pushed that away in order to profit off of the more well known trainees when they debuted (which I get from a short term project but still). It’s their loss for not investing and realizing how much talent gunwook has and what an amazing tone he can work with. Plus he’s smart, and even if he did ever become nugu nugu I’m confident he’d think of something to get more attention. I sincerely feel it in my soul he could strategize ways to keep relevant and promote his future group. Plus with a little more promotion all the ahjummas would love him and he could gain some of the lim young woong voting bloc.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
