Woodz can sing and rap but his dancing is just good but isn’t as great as gunwook’s. Soyeon isn’t that good of a dancer despite her rapping being great and singing good. J-Hope can rap and dance but can’t sing that good. Maybe Hoshi? But his rapping isn’t that strong. One of the nmixx girls maybe? I don’t know… I might be a little too delusional tho. If anyone says sung hanbin or seok Matthew I’d swing though. Hanbin can’t rap (plus his voice is too airy and soft to be convincingly intimidating - remember his AOTM song?). Matthew can’t rap as good as Gunwook either. Don’t get me started on Jiwoong.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
