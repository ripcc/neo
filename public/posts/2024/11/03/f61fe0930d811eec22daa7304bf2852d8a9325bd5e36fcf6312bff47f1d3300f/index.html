It's a lot to copy and paste, so I'll leave that to you since if I did it I would probably run into the word count and have to wait for you to post before linking. Took me a bit longer than usual since the ask was a bit misleading about specific words and I'm busy with stuff. Also yes, I've been around lurking. I think my last reply was something about Luckyz? or maybe about page ordering? I was going to check, but the search function doesn't work properly. Currently going through classes and I have a midterm coming up, but this is a great way to procrastinate.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
