Boys Planet blew up afterwards too and Mnets survival shows especially ones that are Produce101 copies do well. I have watched Project7 and Starlight Boys and can say that Mnet knows how to catch the viewers interest. Their shows are entertaining and those factors made me realise why they are so big. Im the same anon who said that Yuehua and Wakeone might merge older and newer trainees. If the show is even a little bit popular among the fans, they will 100% do that. We all know how much popularity all the Boys Planet boys had at the begining. If Yuehua or Wakeone was smart they would capitalise off of that</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-11-03 17:36:53</small></header><p>this is just my opinion and guess I haven't seen these trainees obviously the reason boys planet blew up was mainly thanks to the trainees mnet can do all their magic and editing it won't stick if people don't like the material. And that's why bp blew it was so odd to see such a good trainee crop after years of boy groups falling off and it would be hard for the same companies to send on par trainees when boys planet was the show for that and it was only two years ago if these mid sized companies put their best out they're not going to scrape together anything close to it in time for planet b the post zb1 groups are looking bleak anyways so that's even less reason for their company's to do some ugly mashes</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
