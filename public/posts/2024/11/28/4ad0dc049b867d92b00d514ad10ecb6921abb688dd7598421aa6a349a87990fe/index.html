Obviously putting Ricky back in was a mistake he really shouldnâ€™t have been edited out in the first place but even switching back the other two thumbnails, itâ€™s an interesting thing how these companies donâ€™t address real concerns but will bend over to the will of akgaes like this. The old thumbnails arenâ€™t that great either ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like for all these performances they obviously use a random frame for the temporary thumbnail when itâ€™s uploaded and then a couple days later go through and chose a better ones and Iâ€™m not even talking about the members on it Iâ€™m talking about overall composition.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
