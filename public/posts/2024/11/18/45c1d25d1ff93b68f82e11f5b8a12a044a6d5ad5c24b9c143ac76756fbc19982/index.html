this is just untrue. first of all, it's almost impossible for her to actually "take over" the company by getting more than 50% of the stake. the court ruled that this plan had never actually gone into effect even though there may have been intent. but doesn't intent really mean anything if it's completely unachievable? yeah, she can get people to buy stocks and slightly lessen hybe's influence but she can't "take over the company" or whatever bullshit. it's just an excuse for hybe retaliating against her after she submitted that internal report and it was a convenient reason for them to have the upper hand in the media buy opening a case against her first.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
