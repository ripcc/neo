The allins of last year would've made sure to cancel everyone including the people getting the threats they used to run shit like the navyyyyyy but truthfully nobody cares when you get hate even if it's member focused lollll like that's just how it is I'm seeing people post the messages they get publicly and only people who either receive the same thing or are in their community care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è if I posted a lot of the stuff I used to get literally nooobody would care not even some of the anons I'm chill with at the end of the day it's anonymous nothing anybody can do ab that</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
