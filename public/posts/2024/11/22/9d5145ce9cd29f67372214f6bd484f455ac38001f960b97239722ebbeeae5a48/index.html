What mnet is also not getting is that they weren’t the ones that made boys planet a success but the pool of trainees they had that year that made it a success but they are so far up their own ass to recognize that, it’s never going to happen again.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

But genuinely I'm confused as to how they're gonna make this work like cfans are gonna rock with a Chinese group made from a Korean channel THEY DGAFFFFFFFF but the fact they're doing these weird concepts is killing me like they're never ever gonna get such a good trainee crop like that or the pure theatrics they presented like wow I've never watched a survival sho forreal but this was theeee most goated and the fact that they're just dragging it through the mud making everything about zb1 2.0 is just blowing me</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
