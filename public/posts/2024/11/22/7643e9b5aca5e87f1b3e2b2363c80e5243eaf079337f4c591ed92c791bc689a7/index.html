Yk how he was when they just debuted and was practically begging to marry fans and gave some of the most intense and like romantic eye contact I’ve ever seen an idol do at fansigns? And now he’s constantly (without ANY shame) saying to his fans to post his photos to their Instagram and say he’s your boyfriend? There was a tweet going around predebut that said something like “gunwook looks cold and intimidating but if you look hard enough in his eye you see someone so eager to please and love and to be loved he can’t control it” and it’s so amazing how that hasn’t changed after being a full fledged idol. Sure what he does is like crack to sasaeng’s but irregardless he’s such a sweet and eager kid, idk how anyone could legitimately hate him. He’s also so smart and sweet it’s heartwarming. I totally get why he’s a social butterfly and every mentor loves him. Truly one of the greats and I really do feel bad for those that randomly hate him. They’re missing out on stanning someone amazing, and actually talented, way above the average standard. Plus he’s super handsome.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>glook</strong>
