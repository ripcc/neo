Not only can she not sing on the show, sheâ€™s besties with that Kelly girl whoâ€™s obviously being actively rigged in. Their performance was ass and it was so clear the team they won over was better. Itâ€™s the nonchalant comfortable nature she has thatâ€™s pissing me off because she knows sheâ€™s gonna get in no matter what. Where is the passion? Desperation? Like fuck Iâ€™d take the evil onepact members over her any day. At least with bahiyyih she could keep up with choreo and looked nervous but showed determination. Fawk Kelly and heuninglea or whatever and their whole squad. Please let the poor other idols who signed onto this hellhole show unknowingly be way more successful than whatever this group will be. Praying for an exposing article be dropped and they get the X1 treatment.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
