Like hasn’t there been a shortage of male idol trainees for years now. Most wouldn’t risk the idol life unless it’s a big 4 company that scouts them and a lot of these male trainees from the current survival shows airing are jumpscares with no charisma like this market is looking bleakkkk we truly got lucky with boys planet and zb1</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And the biggest worry was the clashing timelines of the new group debuting and if zb1 have to be involved which is most likely not happening idk it's kind of getting annoying now cuz the show isn't coming for at least another year LETS LEAVE IT ALONEEEEE cuz exactly just like you said there's 0 chance this group is doing well and zb1s known as a miracle group cuz it's not happening again the kpop survival show market is finished it's too early for all this rara</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
