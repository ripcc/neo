BUT Iâ€™d be lying if it wasnâ€™t funny seeing Armys tweak out that actually BTS maybe arenâ€™t that untouchable and that big bang are generally more respected and well known then them in Asia ðŸ˜­ even if all their fans are older likeeee they still made accomplishments before BTS was doing blackface and cosplaying struggling artists (even tho big hit had funding sources from JYP from the beginning lol but BTS would make it seem like they were Cinderella rather than like what their actual foundation was which is sorta like YGâ€™s Black Label situation). Plus like gd is signed to a label with Palestinian ties while bighit is up scooter Braunâ€™s ass. They can argue that it isnâ€™t up to the artists YADDA YADDA but at the end of the day supporting big hit groups helps fund Zionist with funding ties to Israel. Iâ€™d rather the money go to Palestine. Seeing the crash out post mama has been so entertaining</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
