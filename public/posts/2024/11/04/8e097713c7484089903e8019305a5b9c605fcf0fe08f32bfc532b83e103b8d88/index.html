She’s so beautiful and I’m so tired of fatphobia. And like I know a big reason I got into kpop is the variety and sense of friendships in the groups I wish I had, but now I’m older than some of the groups and find it pathetic I’m so alone and watching reactors react to the things I used to watch in anticipation they feel the same way it react to the same things I did. Parasocialism goes crazy.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

It isn't your forever so try to think and work towards what you want your future to look like and mmmm ig what helped me is just ignoring all thoughts negative or positive about my body cuz it doesn't matter but hope u feel better</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
