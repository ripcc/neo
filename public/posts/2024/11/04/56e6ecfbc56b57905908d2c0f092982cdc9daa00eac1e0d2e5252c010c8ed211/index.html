I remember chungha only left the company because her contract is ending. Looking at how they acted nasty toward chungha after she leave I dont think they would be a saint letting him redebut under new company. I look at their current artists damn I really think they are getting negative profits & the only thing saving them is matthew's pay through zb1. Unless unless some company willing to pay high amout of money then they might actually consider it</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

The thing is they'd have to basically build something around Matthew's entire brand and launch it and expect to come out of that negative profit which is just unlikely they'll let him go unless they're wicked and add him to 8turn</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
