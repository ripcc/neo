Also if anything if they didn't like the murican way they coulda dipped long ago cause their schools are probably better than ours too ðŸ˜­ like u really think they staying here for some ocsa high school diploma ðŸ˜­ but yeah maybe in 20-30 years when his parents made all the money they want and decide to retire and live a life back in china then yeah they could go back but rn they aint dippin just from everything we know cause their intentions all points to staying permanently.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
