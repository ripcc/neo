You can apply for another citizenship, you’ll have 2 passports. They could still be citizens in china and residents in America but they likely have dual citizenship at some point if Ricky says he’s American Chinese</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Ricky says he's American or from la he doesn't really say he's American lol because he spent his formative years there it shaped him so he can claim it</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
