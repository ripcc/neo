After taerae said hello always makes him emotional and highlighted matthew's part for it, matthew made it his mission to always dedicate this part to taerae to make him cry they even did it in macau recently and in Seoul when taerae did get emotional during hello Matthew walked to him to comfort him like I'm sorry but they're probably two of the closest members in the group there's a really deep bond between them</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
