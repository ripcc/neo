But some seem genuinely mad. If this was a girl group there’d be more drama about a minor dancing to dear eclipse like the new jeans cookie debate.
(ps this is not me attacking that post/op, idk who they are, i just saw it and it reminded me of what I’ve been thinking about recent posts like this)</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Like yujin barely had active fans back on intl bptwt and it hasn't changed too much so it's no wonder</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
