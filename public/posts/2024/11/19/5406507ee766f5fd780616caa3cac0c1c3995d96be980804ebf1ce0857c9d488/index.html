See here's the thing about anime there's always going to be some theme that isn't going to sit well like I can't explain it to someone who isn't an avid anime watcher it's just smth that's so common. I rmbr attack on titan (probably one of the biggest animes in history) would get a lot of slack because it has hidden antisemetic themes where the titans are meant to represent Jewish people and the characters are comically German ðŸ˜­ like I knew that and it didn't stop me from watching there's a difference between something like made in abyss that clearly revolves around unnecessary really gross themes involving children to the point the art so horridly depicts and the author IS a pedo... but again it was still well known I know for BNHA which is a huuuuuge anime that I used to watch it's disliked by Chinese people because one of the villains? Uses events from when Japan colonized China and did like testing on innocent people it was pretty horrific and the author used that a lot of things have details not relevant to the overall theme but I feel like maybe idols should just stop recommending stuff it never ends well ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. I haven't watched dandadan myself but it's gotten recommended to me by friends and it's one of the biggest anime's right now I can't confirm if the scenes are relevant to the story or unnecessary because there is a difference between having dark plot points and it not being problematic media and having that and it actually being problematic idk tho I don't have a strong opinion about this but I get it if it's a turn off</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
