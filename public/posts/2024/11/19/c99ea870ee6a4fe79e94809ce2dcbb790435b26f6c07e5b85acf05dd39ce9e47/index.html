Itâ€™s like the only reason people joke about him being the only one who can tolerate jw because he seems to fw the whole group ðŸ˜­ also Iâ€™d agree with you queef he seems really close to Gunwook too especially since the start of this year. Off topic slightly but I kinda like how the dorms changed because itâ€™s interesting to watch how the dynamics change too and who was actually close and who wasnâ€™t like hanbin and Taerae werenâ€™t that close as roomates but seem closer now they arenâ€™t.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
