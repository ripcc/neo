Imo it just seems like he been put into this image he has to upkeep within the group like it took over a year to get a hair colour other than brown. And he’s seemingly not getting anymore tattoos even though members are allowed too. Probably just a personal thing, or my other theory is if he wants to get into acting in the future he doesn’t want to have things like tattoos or piercings be a limiting factor because iirc they have to cover up all tattoos and you rarely see male actors with piercings</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
