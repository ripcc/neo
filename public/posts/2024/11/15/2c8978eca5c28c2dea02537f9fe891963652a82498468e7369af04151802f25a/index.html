<small>2024-11-15 20:44:05</small></header><p>anybody who acts like 1- zb1s momentum wasnt impacted the most by jiwoong and 2- like his scandal was no big deal clearly have no idea about what really happened and how everything played out i cant even really feel too bad for him because besides saying fuck at a fan and getting like what 50k+ quotes in an hour... he quite literally doubled down dug himself into a hole further AND WOULDNT STOP... the bubble messages didnt stop the proverbs didnt stop the cracked up public appearances didnt stop.. and the fact that he was never active before that still blows me to this day like he really ruined so much ðŸ˜­ not to mention the company LITERALLY threatening the fan under the guise of legal action using specific situations regarding hanbin and gunwook but also the fact that after noody believed the bogus dispath article about the forensice evidence they tried to shift blame to matthew and taerae like what???? and then the nerve of him to withdraw any effort from the group at their most vulnerable moment their depressiona dn schizophrenia in spring was literally because of the chain of events that followed his actions angdakkjung haunted this group till septmeber. he was already not close to anyone but it felt like he was just there he attempted to use ricky right after but that was it like damn the most youd get from jiwoong was a lie hed make up at a fansign about a random member.. genuinely crazy. and thank you the original zb1 board that had been used since before they debuted literally died everyone from fans to casuals (new ones we lost all our old ones LOL) to new fans use the ot8 board and most of the time new fans dont even acknowledge him when they start stanning like please spare me the moral word salad idc. how we feel about jiwoong is how we feel about him i try to cut down the unnecessary excessive hate cuz it doesnt do anything so they were really capping cuz ill show what REAL hate looks like ugh</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
