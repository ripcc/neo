I say itzy even tho their prospects are worse because they actually were a top gg projected to do just as well as twice for a couple years so they have that reach they'd only get a fraction of that now if jyp invested in them it's too late now tho jyp messed up baddddd</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
