There are some things that might be viewed as calculated but not in the negative way, I.e purposely shutting down the dating rumours when he did because they were getting really big at that time. It was a good calculated choice for him to call it out when he did rather than ignore it and let it get bigger.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
