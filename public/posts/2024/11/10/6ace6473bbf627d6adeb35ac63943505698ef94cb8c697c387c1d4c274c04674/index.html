I then sent you an anon like a month after that saying I got it. So, I did get it, and now Iâ€™m working for a Governor rn thatâ€™s getting a LOT of attention on social media. I wonâ€™t say which one because there are a few popping off rn BUT imagine how insane itâ€™d be for a freaking anon from this page to end up working for the future president of the United States come 2028 (if they run and are elected and I stay with their office god willing) ðŸ’€ . Iâ€™d be carrying my Gunwook photocard through the halls of the White House like an emotional support teddy bear ðŸ˜­. Theyâ€™d never know a mattwook truther is among them ðŸ’€ðŸ˜­</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
