Literally everyone, including Koreans, were extremely sympathetic towards him after the strawberry nuisance. I don't even called it an incident; everyone was calling him talented and feeling bad for him. If he had done some fake apology like he was on dieting and felt hungry, so that's why I ate barely 40 calories of strawberry, and he apologized for that. He would have gotten even more empathy and support from non-Zeros.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
