Or is it his fans who wants that from him and it has nothing to do with hanbin??? I don't know much about yujin or how he is with his fans. But recently he dyed his hair blonde for the concert after Hanbin's blonde (which may not mean anything), but after Hanbin's platinum blonde in Swarovski event which a lot of fans liked, Yujin went platinum blonde too (this shocked me, it may not mean anything to some of you but I found it creepy). Hanbin has been talking about doing a ddungjungham washing live after fans mentioned about him doing that last year but now yujin did a vlog washing with yunini. Is it his fans requesting him to do them?. I'm not mad or anything but a little weirded out because hanbin didn't even get to do the ddungjungham washing live even though he promised us to do one (he doesn't forget his promises actually, and he brought that doll in his macau live probably to compensate for not doing the doll washing live)...</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
