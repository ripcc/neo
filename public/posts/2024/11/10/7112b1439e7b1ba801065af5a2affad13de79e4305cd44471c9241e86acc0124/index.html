I disagree with the sentiment he hates himself for it because he wouldn’t continuously mention that he’s proud of his past (linked to queee spaces) or make comments that allude to being queer but I do think there’s a pressure on him from the industry/ his fans and ultimately manifested into him imposing it on himself that he needs to present a certain way.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
