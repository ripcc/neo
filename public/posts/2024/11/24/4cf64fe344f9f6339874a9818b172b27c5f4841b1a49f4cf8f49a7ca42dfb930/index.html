Hanbin is on the dance line, he should be getting more things than other members. Like no offense but Taerae, Gyuvin, Jiwoong or Ricky not getting anything wouldn't be as scandalous bc they are not main dancers and the weakest ones when it comes to dancing too. That being said, they are making an scandal when he's probably getting more at the Gayos and all that.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
