Okay typing that just sounds stupid like someone's who's coping would say because that's wonyoung were talking about ðŸ˜­ Okay they're probably equal in core fandom but Wonyoung definitely has the bigger reach to non Ive fans so I guess it's up to which type of fans starship values more? Yujin has bf stans I'm assuming = more money and wonyoung is more of an inspiration to younger female fans so they won't spend as much? But at the same time even as a girl wonyoung is pretty hot and I doubt she has no bf stans so I don't know I've been seeing this ive fiasco on my timeline the past two days and there's definitely a noticeable bias towards yujin.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
