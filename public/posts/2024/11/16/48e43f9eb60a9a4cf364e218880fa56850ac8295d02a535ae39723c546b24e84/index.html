We just knew because Yujin keeps dropping clues. Mnet didn't even announce the opening acts and Hao opening the show was a shocking that I cried for 2 reasons. Out of happiness and regret that I didn't get day 1mama. Fucking mnet. I think sales is low that they have to hype the opening acts. Last year was sold out for 2 days right?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
