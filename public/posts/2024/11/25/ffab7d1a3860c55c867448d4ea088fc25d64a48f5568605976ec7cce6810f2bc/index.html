Im actually in uni studying dentistry now so I’m not shocked that he didn’t get stitches because for health and safety they literally can’t give them to him because the raising blood pressure in the plane could make them burst, i actually think Gunwook said something similar to him after about not raising his blood pressure (this smart king) but I’m shocked that there even though there was nothing to help the skin heal and he was still doing stuff like dance practice . Like I totally get not missing the group schedule that they filmed because it can be hard to reschedule and work around and like another anon said this fandom tweaks out when someone missed something but the still going to dance practice is wild. Also writing this just reminded me of that time he was seen with a wrist/ hand split and then was flying out and performing with no splint on just days later. We already knew this company dgaf tho about the health and wellbeing of their artist and not just within zb1 but we see it with all their artist. /+r/201f196072</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
