Liek the Swarovski thing was a random audio clip alluding to a male idol fandom that could've been hyunjae (has more trolls) and it wasn't either of the idols so not their faults really and op clarified but I heard that didn't get as much attention but even then people except the akgaes trying to force it were mad at hanbin. So that in turn probably made it easier to koreaboo to take shit down probably with mass dming and clarification they're washed af but that was some nasty work using his face</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
