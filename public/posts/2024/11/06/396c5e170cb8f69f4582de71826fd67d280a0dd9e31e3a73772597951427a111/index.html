Because we don’t know what deal wakeone and yuehua have on his management and your right China work isn’t going to help him as much as work in korea but I’m sure this is a recycled argument but if he’s using up his free weeks/ time to film and promote his China work how much time does that leave for work in korea. Ntm it’s not just about his availability but also the availability of the shows/ PDs. Like he did lofficiel, kustie and olay all in august (cmiiw) so realistically how free do you think his schedule was.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
