I've only seen clips of some of these shows and they are boring af, making some really unrealistic drama out of no where. Mnet are snakes but they are snakes that can actually tell a good story. Also, I feel like the quality of trainees in Boys Planet was just sooo top tier compared to so many shows. I remember seeing the Top 18 and thought, yea the talent here is really great, I could see two teams forming from them. Like Fantasy Boys airing around the same time, people could see the difference LOL. Also not for nothing, I think the advantage of BP trainees skewing a bit older made me remember why debuting trainees that have had years of experiences vs. like 2 months makes soo much of a difference. Like thinking about 3rd gen when you had idols like Twice's Jihyo (10 years trainee) and Exo's Suho (7 years) or like the average being 2-4 years of trainee experience for debuted idols vs. now where I feel like the trainee periods in general can feel like less than 6 months for some (and it shows). Ofc there's always exceptions to that, but even then, with idols like Baekhyun and Chen (who both were like less than a year, maybe only a few months) were already a bit older when they debuted so just goes to show experience matters.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
