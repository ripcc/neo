Ik it's not strictly separated by nationality but I really only see korean trainees going for k group and not c, imo there will def be chinese trainees going for both though based on their personal goals Also fs they'd love to recreate another person who brings in hao levels of money /+r/40a9c870ea</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

That doesn't make sense like yea there's a good chunk of Chinese kpop fans but they'd also probably just tune into the average kpop sitch esp made by a korean show ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it makes no sense and exactly Chinese trainees can go into the Korean group part so it's already divided attention if that's what they're going for this is gonna be so bust like this might do just as bad as the jtbc and iqyi shows</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
