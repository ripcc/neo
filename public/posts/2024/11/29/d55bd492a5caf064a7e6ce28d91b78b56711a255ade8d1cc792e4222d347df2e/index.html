Honestly it’d be GENUIS if min hee Jin found a way to influence and create their contract so it could easily be able to be terminated. Could she have foresaw bighit being stupid af and prioritizing Le Sserafim and plan ahead via contract tweaks? I think she could have, especially considering she already knew they were in the works or HYBE had plans for them before new jeans debuted. Don’t forget she was from SM, she knows about contracts and knows what to expect in a shitty company. I honestly think New Jeans knows the best about the legalities, plus all five of their families + attorneys. I think there’s a 90% chance they’ll get away with it. Considering their sponsors are keeping them, that’s a BIG sign. I really do hope they get away with it, sincerely.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
