I feel like the fandom i've seen with the least akgaes have been twice that's because jyp promoted them exclusively as ot9 for years. iz*one is an interesting case because they had akgaes in the beginning until the rigging scandal x1 disbandment happened and they became united /+r/6aaff8cdfe</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
