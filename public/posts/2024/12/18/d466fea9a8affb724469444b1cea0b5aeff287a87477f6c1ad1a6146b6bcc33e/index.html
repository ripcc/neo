Hold on before you block me-let me explain. It really did stifle a lot of growth and fractured their fandom in half. Obviously zb1 has lost some fans along the way but I’m glad we didn’t lose even more to Riize, who, if the scandals never happened, would be the closest alternative. Now they’re like BND level rookie fame instead of what they could’ve been. And if they were absolutely scandal free - and we dealt with another jiwoong level of scandal, I think they could’ve overtaken us. I am thankful to really believe zb1 will go out as the top (sales wise) group in 5th Gen. They broke so many awards, and they’ll have a long legacy as the ones to open up 5th Gen. Also, all album sales in kpop are trending down, so people dragging their sales not being as high as in bloom are delusional. Some groups still might grow but 2020-early 2023 had inflated numbers due to covid and across the industry, even with the top groups, you’ve seen a gradual decline in album sales and engagement to around 2018/19 levels. Now I’m having fun imagining and predicting what will happen with each member. It feels like kpop fantasy football</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

But... no they're not tbh like riice are still wayyyy bigger than poond domestically and internationally like it's not even close. And Snghans scandal didn't do a damn thing for zbwon it made shit worse and just heightened everything. I think we would've got maybe a fraction less of the hate if jwgs scandal wasn't after snghan leaving and coming back and leaving. it brought attention and pity on riize that would never ever be extended to zbwon and domestically they still win the only thing we got was their intl fandom being destroyed. They're a perm sm group tho it'll be back LOL</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
