If thereâ€™s one thing zerose will do is make up a story in their own heads and then gaslight everyone else into believing it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. Everyone saying wk1 was refusing birthday gifts for jw, no they werenâ€™t there was just deadass no one in the company to accept them so the delivery companies had to return them the same way any delivery company does when you miss a package ( although I agree they should have made it clear to fans when they should send gifts so that could have been avoided) and fans who are going in person now the boys are in korea are successfully dropping off their gifts like ik his message book got delivered and the gifts from one of his fanbases. Donâ€™t get me started on people tweaking about the live. So many artist are cancelling lives and especially birthday lives, wakeone is probably not rescheduling the same reason no other company is rescheduling and simply cancelling, they donâ€™t know how this political situation could progress and when it will be ok for them to do stuff like lives. Also rosins and wdgs fighting like wow can we all just shut up and live.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
