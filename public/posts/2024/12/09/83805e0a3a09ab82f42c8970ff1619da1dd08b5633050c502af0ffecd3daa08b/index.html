When he was in monsta X he actually said once during a live that he hated his muscles and wanted to get rid of it so people knew more about him as a person instead of just his muscles. Obviously itâ€™s sort of what most people know about now and he sorta has to keep up with it to retain some of his relevancy but like I wish people knew how sweet he is and that his music is good and that he actually left monsta X to help protect an ex of his who transitioned but he didnâ€™t want them to be revealed or his group to be dragged through the mud so those are the reasons he leftâ€¦ itâ€™s so ðŸ˜­. Not only that but his upbringing was rough and his mom got evicted while he was a traineeâ€¦ thereâ€™s so much lore to him. Heâ€™s a total softie too and like one of the only male idols I genuinely believe have somewhat good social beliefs because of his history predebut and him protecting his ex. Obviously you never really know but like, at least thereâ€™s good evidence for him. Plz check out some of his music yall there are like two ballads but besides those the rest of his music has really good bass and beats/melodies</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
