Basically yesterday topclass her og company said the reason xt would not be participating in Keplers kr schedules is because of the politics in kr rn which makes no sense because no other chn idol is having issues promoting and they said they would always prioritise group stuff. Then xt posted a pic of Pinocchio on her ig story. Then like half an hour ago wakeone posted a statement basically going against everything top class said and basically said her China schedules is the reason she’s missing the groups kr schedules for the whole of December (so top classes fault for clashing the schedules and not rearranging) then her fans were like 50/50 on who to blame because it’s like he said she said. But xt just went onto bubble and said “ the korean company? i’m so grateful for all their support, and since there are no restrictions on my activities, please don't misunderstand~” so it’s safe to say the problem is her og company. But it makes it obvious that dual management would never work</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
