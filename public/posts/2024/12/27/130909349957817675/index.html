So those rumors didnt surprise me but I never believed it either because if you hear anecdotes from his classmates who actually interacted with him on a daily that had actual faces to back up their claims and not a random faceless anon on douban they all said what queef said how he was nice but extremely introverted and shy ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ and those rumors started on douban pls for the love of gawd never trust anything on there because they were the same ones saying his dad was a military spy for america and the chinese gov found out so america quickly saved them and gave them immediate residency hence why they were able to get a house so quickly and live lavishly ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ also tbh just dont believe any rumors during bp days because 99% of that is made up bs to bring other trainees down because it was a competition like the amount of shit i had to read about hao I wanted to die on a daily because dumb mofo believe that shit and bring in onto twt where ppl are even dumber /+r/1307675614</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
