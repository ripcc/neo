Jiwoong=gets in serious relationships and can do ltr but will probably cheat a lot , he'd be like off set like he's getting married and showing off his wife and everything but he's still gonna cheat a few times maybe a lot Hao=I also thought Hao was the type to treat everything as a fling but w how much we know about his past now I'd say he seems like he can do both flings and serious relationships, i think he's the type to leave the door open and check his options in case the relationship turn sour and maybe emotionally cheat but I don't see him as a cheater tbh we know the most about him and while he gives hoe he seems to like relationships and romance a lot Hanbin= he does give gets cheated on vibes but he does give me insatiable heaux vibes so idk I'll go with loyal but maybe some emotional cheating and testing of boundaries because hanbin is very affectionate Taerae= lowkeyyy gives cheater vibes like Hao he needs attention but Hao gives more secure vibes to me while Taerae gives desperate+Taerae used to be big so even less confidence Matthew= seems secure and emotional idt he'd do it tbh maybe he'd test boundaries if he has a crush on someone else during his ltr but I think he wouldn't act on it Ricky= I don't think he'd cheat tbh I think he'd only be in chill casual relationship and if he wanted to get with someone else he'd just open the relationship or break up Gunwook= low-key gives insatiable too but also has a big heart and morals tbh idk if gunwook is a big big romantic I see him as having a hoe phase and maybe doing a few people dirty in his early twenties but when he's in late twenties he figures himself out and will be loyal to who he chooses to marry Yujin= definitely has a huge roster and plays in each of these girls faces, he really does like all ten of them tho</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
