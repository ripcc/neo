Not to mention almost all their groups has had a member leave or go on a long hiatus. Like this isn't new to the industry and for sure they aren't the only company with these conditions but i always hated the fact that jyp had this wholesome family image for kpop stans</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
