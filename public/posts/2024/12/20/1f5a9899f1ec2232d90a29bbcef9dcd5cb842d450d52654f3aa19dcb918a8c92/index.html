This was similar with aespa a few years ago with awful shitty choreo and they were unsynchronized as hell but they got rid of their entire stage direction team and replaced them with this amazing japanese stage director and they have memorable choreos and iconic performances now but it took literally years because they were so close to their previous ones but i’m glad they got rid of them</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
