Can we go back to bp finale haobin hug, videos from every single angle went viral on ktwt and nb was like the biggest rps ship there. Any kind of popularity is still popularity. We could've had it all if nb got into more fanservicey ship like mattwook, gyubrik and if there was no competition over nb vs bn. what I don't understand though is the rikjyung, jyungbin, and jiwoong yujin ship also being on top. All these ships with uncle are boring</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
