He’d be loyal af but have high expectations of you and a high af sex drive. I think with him he’d be loyal based off of principle and take pride in it. But I do get the sense he’d want to fuck a lot and also hold you and your accomplishments to a higher standard (but also support and encourage you, but there would def still be pressure). So, not a cheater, but if you’re insecure he’d be a hard partner to be with because he’d try to push you above it and he’d be hit on a lot due to how eager to please he is in all aspects of his life. I can see Jiwoong and Hao cheating tho (Jiwoong just because he dgaf and Hao because he’d get lost in the moment but feel bad about it after). Taerae could def be a swinger so not a cheater but multiple partners.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I'm kinda stuck on hao but someone called tartar an insecure cheater and it's kinda tea</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
