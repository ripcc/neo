And we know that companies heavily push their idols to do/say some things for pr in zb1 it's very obvious as they're an especially controlled group
-Zb1 have had multiple appearances overseas last year and even earlier this year, but there was a switch that happened in my opinion somewhere this year specifically I think it was partially influenced by the clout zb1 got when they interacted with fans in Japan, partially due to new company strategies
-The shift is with how they present themselves publicly, when the members are overseas they usually have to have staffs around them at all and they usually need to be covered up yet for ex in macau, almost the entire group was just walking in the mall maskless, this is super inconvenient and isn't something that would have happened last year
-I think the easiest example is luckyz because everyone knows they're a very obviously pushed "pr" duo, I thought them hanging out in Japan last time and posting literally all the time was obvious enough (bcs members who organically hang out do not make that much content out of it it would usually be from a schedule), but again today they went out in public completely maskless and "visible clothes" even tho these two arguably have the most ssngs, afaik the only time luckyz have hung out in seoul was during the yhz dinner, it is obvious then esp when you compare the sightings of ggyuvin hanging out alone and hanbin w staffs where they actively make an effort to hide, that they are being massively seen on purpose.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
