But I wouldn't be surprised just because now the country's on high alert I don't think affects their work in Japan just cuz it's an internal issue with a president trying to enact a temporary dictatorship most likely things are probably gonna proceed as is especially cuz this all happened around midnight that's just my guess tho</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
