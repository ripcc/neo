Like other seokryus can have their opinions but Iâ€™ve been in kpop way too long and have seen how it goes for a lot of ex survival group members and unless a big 4 pick him up his best chance is redebuting with some members in a decent company ðŸ˜­ /+r/d104b7777f</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-12-03 22:15:54</small></header><p>the only other outcome I can think of is a company buying Matthew out (dead mission) cuz mnh is definitely not debuting a group and has barely shown up for him during his time in zb1 except a truck like ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and exactly I agree I get mixed opinions too but feelings aside it's truly the best for both gunwook and Matthew if they want any fraction of what they have now theyll debut with other members, half the group already have a cushion with a future.. they don't!!!!!!! Thel1ve seems to be the best company out of the members anyways like we're making pilgrimage to this fantasy land don't careeeeee cuz the chances of a big4 company scouting them is 0 like besides sm the other 3 are dead missions wow sis you get meeeee like can we just get this group cuz now I want it</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
