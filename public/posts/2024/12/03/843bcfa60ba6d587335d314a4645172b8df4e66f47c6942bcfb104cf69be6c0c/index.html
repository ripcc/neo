But he is not that good at hiphop (even though his moves look neat and sharp, Matthew and Gunwook are better to look at because of their groove) like he does with tutting, waacking, and voguing. His predebut dance videos are much better than the ones we see now even the aotm tutting isn't as great as his predebut ones. But we can never see him do that again, he seems to want to do more hiphop now which has nothing to do with wk1 restricting him because they let him add those little tutting choreos in performances. /+r/e8aa49ac0c</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
