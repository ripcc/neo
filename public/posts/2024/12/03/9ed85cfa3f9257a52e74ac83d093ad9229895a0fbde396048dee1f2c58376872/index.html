Whoever has control of the military is the one in power, and who’s to say that the military heads will follow the law. Keep in mind too of what the military is made up of - mostly 20-30 year old men. Demographics that are statistically super misogynistic and anti-progressive values. Even outside of the official power and who holders control, look at the social sentiment. Now tell me, who would they prefer to work under or push for? A dictator with similar beliefs or the Democratic Party version of legislators? Exactly. It’s a scary time for everyone, but I’m extremely concerned about South Korean women.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
