It's not only about dance gigs, and this doesn't apply only to Hanbin. We need to be real with ourselves and accept that they give zb1 choreographies that are below their dancing level, they get gg choreos in the sense that they are pretty jazzy dances rather than getting choreos with ballroom or hip hop foundations. When you look at riize and tws dances it shows, even when TWS music is also soft in the way that zb1 is, their choreos have more hip hop elements than zb1 choreos do. We have Matthew who is a great hip-hop dancer but if you look at him dancing zb1 choreos, that doesn't show. Zb1 choreos only favour certain members and the worst part is that none of them are the members of the "dance line".</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>dearcupid</strong>
