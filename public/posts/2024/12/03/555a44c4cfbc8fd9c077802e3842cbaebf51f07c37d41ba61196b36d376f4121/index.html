If soyeon go solo then both her and the group will fall down, she's good in making songs but lets be real sy can't thrive by being soloist and the group can't thrive without her. And I keep on seeing her videos of saying she put the group first above all so I guess the other companies can't fulfill the terms she wanted for the group</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
