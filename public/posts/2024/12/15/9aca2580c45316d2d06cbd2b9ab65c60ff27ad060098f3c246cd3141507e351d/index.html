Ik it's too much to ask idols to consider their personal features before getting the current trendy filler/makeup style but his just dont harmonize with his classically balanced features idk like they take up too much space on his face and draw attention away from his gaze in a bad way. Imo a bit of lip filler only look good if your lips have a natural pouty shape (and a lot of filler almost never looks good) which his dont at all they are naturally so sharp and flat but like that was a charm point for him. But I felt the same way when itzy yeji started getting them then she came to balance them out with makeup or maybe I just got used to them lol but still #justiceforpapercuts.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
