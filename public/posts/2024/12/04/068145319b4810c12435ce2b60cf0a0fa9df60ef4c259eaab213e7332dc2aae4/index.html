Like the many arm movements. Most of the boys look better in hiphop but the choreos look like the styles that Hanbin had during predebut and he said himself that he's participating in choreo adjustment because we've seen how they change from the original that are more on hiphop side rather than jazzy, interpretative and ballroom. /+r/ff8d103bdc</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
