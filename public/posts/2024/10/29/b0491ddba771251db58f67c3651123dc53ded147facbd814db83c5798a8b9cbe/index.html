It seems like the team she works with isn’t directly under wakeone but rather cj because they have labelled themselves as under cj not wakeone. Someone else from the same team has the same planner/marketer in her bio so I’m guessing that’s her role. So she’s on the marketing team which would explain why she’s at all these events if she’s on marketing.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
