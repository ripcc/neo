Like obviously theyâ€™re going to have a strategy to make the member least liked in a group likable again and to gain some more popularity (using Seungkwan to warm up Joshuaâ€™s perception), whatâ€™s so wrong with that??? Just send them to a few variety shows and make him likable. Another thing is of course theyâ€™re going to keep tabs on their competition, Iâ€™d also be plotting how to make my artist (which Iâ€™d already invested millions into training, procedures, promotions, etc.) into being the most well known. Where I draw the line is like them actively pushing rumors and unwarranted hate (especially the Monsta X Wonho case), but the theoretical part is basic business (without the genuine evil actions, monopolization, company racketeering and media control). I even understand the yaoi ranking tracking, like yaoi sells ðŸ˜­ youâ€™d think haobin would be like as popular as they currently are if they didnâ€™t have the biggest ship to promote each of them last year?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
