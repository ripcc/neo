Like, heâ€™s stated the only thing he wants to do is repay his mom for adopting him. Idc itâ€™s heartwarming and heâ€™s chill and I like his vocal tone (+he can dance). Sucks itâ€™s like his fifth show but I genuinely hope he eventually reaches success.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
