She's basically taking a break because her relationship with rukidans aren't the best rn since this was the first time Ricky got a lil bit of hate from knets hence why they told her to go back to stanning Jiwoong ðŸ˜­ Because to Koreans, every Korean knows there's no such thing a pluschat/ bubble ban since the money goes directly to the artist so there's no reason for the company to block it, even if Ricky did get a ban for whatever reason it just sounds absurd to Koreans so they were mad a Balloon for reposting it and getting Ricky his first mini wave of hate because it just sounds so stupid to koreans, like some sort of conspiracy theory fans are making up to shield the artist for their inactivity. Dumbass riyangis think rukidans blame Ricky for not posting, yeah they did in April but then saw him try and saw his effort but he slowly went back to his April days so they accepted him for who he is but riyangis still be counting every single day he doesn't post creating a problem out of nothing. Another misconception is rukidans are not dismissing the pluschat ban either because there could be a slight chance for it to be true but for Balloon, who is Ricky's biggest fan account to post something she's not 100% sure on that led to his first mini hate is why rukidans are pissed at her.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
