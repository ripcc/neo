I'm still surprised he didnt come at all since day 2 concert cuz he has to know what has happened so I seriously think ricky is trying to tell those pchat ban believers to stop by not coming at all and c'mon lets be real he only came day 2 concert cuz gyuvin told him fans were worried about his thumb since they were asking about it on gyuvins own pchat and gyuvin had to reassure ricky was fine himself and then ricky came right after. like theyre saying ricky isnt coming now cuz he got in trouble for that fancall but then what about the entire 2 weeks of gsb promos, why didn't he come then? what trouble was he in back then for him not to come for 2 weeks? like they seriously just need to accept he doesn't come and its completely okay i mean it sucks too cuz u want to see ur fav everyday and get to know them more on a personal level but at the same time ur stanning ricky someone who values privacy and likes being alone..... idk mayb stan someone else atp then cuz ur gonna be counting when hes not posting even after zb1 lbfr like what happens then? is it yuehuas fault?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
