What kind of conspiracy is this KKKKKKKKKKKKKKK'
'South American Birds be making up conspiracies because they don't want to accept their idol is inactive'
'If he wanted to post he would've, what is this stupid shield?' Stuff like that and these aren't even rukidans tweeting these it's random knets who saw the tweet and saw how stupid a 'pluschat/ bubble ban sounds' and stupid Noyb said it was rukidans.... I need that her to stfu because now dumbass riyangi's who follow her believe every bs she says even if it aint true and think rukidans are the spawn of the devil sucking Wakeone's dick. If rukidans didn't cuss her out saying things like 'why are you posting something you're not sure off and attracting aggro to Ricky?' 'you of all people should know Ricky best, is this your way of punishing Ricky for not coming after pleading for him to come in April?' (again for context, Balloon is Korean so she knows how absurd a pluschat ban sounds to Koreans so rukidans are asking if she's purposely doing this to attract hate because Ricky didn't listen to her) and basically if she kept her account public and the tweet got into the wrong hands it would turn into racism and even political.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
