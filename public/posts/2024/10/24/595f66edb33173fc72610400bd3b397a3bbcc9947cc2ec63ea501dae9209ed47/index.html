btw, anon, crosins don't give a fuck about the artists from yh kr and they're convinced zh is going to be a soloist anyway so they don't care that much about what happened to uniq, everglow, tempest, etc.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-24 08:40:16</small></header><p>okay but my thing is theyre asking for the impossible because even if duhua could give the world to hao (she cant do korean resources anyways) hes not her idol and he promotes in a different country im just failing to see where this idea of her being able to craft the next yibo WHILE hao is in korea in zb1 works... sure theyre building him up but thats literally all they can do and its excessive hes going onto what his 5th? endorsement and in less than 6 months ðŸ˜­ and again he cant focus or have chinese? (idk if u mean chinese or korean) gp exposure while hes active in zb1 hed have to choose one or the other and i think its stupid to fail to consider hao being in yuehua kr cuz its likely and hes already signed there no? my point still stands tho theyre living in a dream and duhua isnt even waiting on hao since shes working on ollie</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
