My roommate left her clothing in the dryer and, when my clothes finished in the washer, I moved them out into her basket so I could dry my clothes. I texted the groupchat about me moving the stuff and she got aggressive and said I was being disrespectful and taking away her privacy by moving her clothes. I told her that people should set timers and she doubled down saying I was in the wrong and that I should’ve texted the groupchat for them to get their clothing instead. I get not wanting others to touch your clothes but she could just set timers and not leave her clothing sitting there for over an hour after they were done (also what if she’s not home and I need to dry something?). Am I being stubborn or is she in the wrong?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
