I thought Jennie would bank on her international fame and target the ifans then her song will also blow up in Korea. In my mind, Ros√© will flop. Lisa is doing what I expected her to do though. Relying on her man. I forgot that Ros√© has this businesswoman brain and she really is smart. Get the man charting no.1 on charts. No fucking promo. Just drop the shit and then hit.Jennie is being edgy with her feminism though I do think that she would have hit it big in Korea if Ros√© didn't drop Apt. Why drop on the same month btw? Competing with each other on charts is crazy</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
