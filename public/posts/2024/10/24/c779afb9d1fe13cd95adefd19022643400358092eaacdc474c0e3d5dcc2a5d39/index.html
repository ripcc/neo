I also have a theory that his most recent period of heavy inactivity was bc of how demanding and annoying ris were being about his working out, styling and trying to micromanage random shit. Like for a while he would just log on to plus chat to clarify random things about his styling so he might have just got annoyed seeing all that.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
