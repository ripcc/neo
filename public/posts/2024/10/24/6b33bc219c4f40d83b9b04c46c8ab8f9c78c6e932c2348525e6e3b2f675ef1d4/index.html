I think in Korea she is still the most popular bp member but k gp is 50/50 when early bp almost everyone loved her, just my take tho. I actually think jennie has the most appeal to global audience idk her personality seems appealing to global fans you know that strong independent sensual image but I can see her being too 'bitchy' too so idk actually ðŸ˜­ also what do u have against jisoo LOOL</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
