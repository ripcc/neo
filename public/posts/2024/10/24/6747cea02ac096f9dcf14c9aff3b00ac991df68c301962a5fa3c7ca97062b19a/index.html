but if I'm being honest, I don't think wk1 hates them ðŸ˜­ it's just that whoever manages them is incompetent asf. I do think ricky's lack of socmed presence in their official accounts is weird tho because sometimes the staff will post pictures of every single member but him ðŸ˜­
but going back to the "wk1 hates yhz" conspiracy, yhz themselves encourage that mentality with the exception of yujin ðŸ˜­ hao flames and "exposes" wk1 every day, ricky said the company knew he was unhappy and that he wants to be more active on ig and +chat but can't, and gyuvin told a fan who wanted to audition for wk1 to run away and to audition for yuehua instead ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like, what are their fans supposed to think when their favs say stuff like that?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
