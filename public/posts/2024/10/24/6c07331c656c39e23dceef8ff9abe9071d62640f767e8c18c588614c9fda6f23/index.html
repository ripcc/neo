The guy was given 3 songs to choose from and picked Apt since it sounds fun. Luckily, the song has Korean touch which made it easier for the gp to love it. For ifans, it's curiosity because it's Bruno & finding out that the song was actually fun. Jennie's Mantra was supposed to be big, let's be honest. It's the Karina blocking her and then Ros√© coming from nowhere that ruined her flower. Now, Jennie's company is struggling and lost. Everyone is so focused on Apt now. Like, promoting Mantra won't do aynthing. Might as well give up and try again next time. Such a missed opportunity though.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
