From what I know he went to a private kindergarten in shanghai then after a few years he transferred to an international school then I don't know how many years passed he came to the states, he then went to Portola then transferred to OCSA then he came to Korea. Like he never really stayed in one place long enough or had time to establish a deep friendship so it makes sense why he's so introverted and prefers to do things alone and don't have many close friends.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
