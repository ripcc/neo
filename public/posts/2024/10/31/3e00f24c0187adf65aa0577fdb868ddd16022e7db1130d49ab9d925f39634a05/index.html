Idgaf about the arguments: yes min hee Jin is weird, yes HYBE sucks ass, YADDA YADDA YADDA but NO ONE can objectively deny those girls aren’t doing something absolutely insane and deserve a little respect for it. What they’re doing could very much lead to higher workers rights for idols and maybe, just maybe, idol unionism in like a decade or so. They are building upon what TVXQ did over 15 years ago and by going directly against a conglomerate, genuinely exposing the company’s insane fraud and actual plans to get rid of them, and by getting almost universal support from the general public except insane HYBE worshipers, they are creating a shift towards not only idol loyalty to a company but also widespread support for an artist against their conglomerate company. With TVXQ support was split about half/half, now it’s almost fully for artists on NewJeans case. Creating a burn account to go against your own company was insanely brave. Even if they were “manipulated” into doing it, it doesn’t take away the potential consequences of it and the bravery. If NewJeans are able to survive and succeed and thrive, it’ll encourage other idols to coming to light with their own exploitation stories on a bigger platform rather than just the rare interview a decade after their careers died or like an odd few shady comments. NewJeans are the ones actually changing the idol industry. And I’m saying this as someone who found their music generic and didn’t like their vocal skills. What they are doing are also stirring up conversations of workers rights in South Korea, like damn.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Im not saying she isnt weird but people trying to make her albeit unprofessional relationship with the girls seem pedophilic and that theyre brainwashed and selling themselves to her rubbed me the wrong wayyyyyy thats why i feel like were here. Since the beginning ive been on their side and the live was truly the best thing they couldve done people dont realize their fate was going to be sealed as a forgotten punished group under hybe like we gotta give it to them theyre integral and if a hybe blockade really does happen itll be because of them take that yunjin 😝</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
