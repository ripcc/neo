I think Matthew probably vaped a bunch in highschool and his first year in korea but he seems like with his gym journey he probably full stopped don't think he was ever heavy
Gyuvin is those people sooooo against drinking and smoking but he'll vape like this guy probably don't play about his pingdu vape
I agree w everything else</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
