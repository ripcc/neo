Nothing against them but like as a bitch with big thighs I 1. Probably wouldn’t be their type and 2. Even if we did find each other attractive I’d be scared to hurt them. Idk, food for thought. I know idol culture is like idolizing and fantasizing about these idols being “your boyfriends” but tbh I don’t think I’d want them to be mine when I think seriously about it. Also, truthfully I don’t think most of them would be good fawks too. Like, you seriously telling me most male idols would ever eat 🐱? Hell no. I’m 100% sure there are more female idols who are munches (the lesbian, bi, and pan queens) than male idols. The only thing they might have is good stamina from years of dancing but like, half of idol actors kiss scenes are painful to watch so stamina isn’t everything 😭</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
