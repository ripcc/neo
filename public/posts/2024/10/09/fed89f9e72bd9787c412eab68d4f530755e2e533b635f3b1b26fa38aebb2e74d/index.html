Like I remember liking the way pages were organized for onehallyu when I checked it out before it went down. I don't think it's isolated to onehallyu, but it was the first example that came to mind. This format is fine and all if you just want to get the earliest ask, but, for example, if you wanted asks from a week ago, there isn't a specific range you could look at/save since you kind of have to jump around and a week later the range wouldn't reference that time period. The most recent ask page could then be referenced, for example, by both https://neospring.org/@requeefiem and https://neospring.org/@requeefiem?page=35 (page of last ask). I don't know the specifics behind how it would be implemented or if it would work with how its currently set up so maybe it's not possible. As of rn, https://neospring.org/@requeefiem is the same as https://neospring.org/@requeefiem?page=0 .</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
