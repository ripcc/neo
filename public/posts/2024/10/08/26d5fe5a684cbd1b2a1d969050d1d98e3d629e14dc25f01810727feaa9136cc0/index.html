Even if they graduate high school that’s keeping in mind if they went to a performance or art one there is likely to be less stress on academics, and if they’re currently an idol while being in high school, a lot of their projects and requirements were probably relaxed due to their profession. So even those that make it to high school graduation are probably not all that. I also sort of feel bad when I do hear about smart idols who gave up probably a very normal and professional career to become an idol. I think it was one of the members of the girl group IRRIS who’s studying law at MIT, and I wish I could shake her and ask why she would choose to debut nugu over focusing on her law degree. Like you’re diverting focus that could be put in internships for a super unstable career. I think this is also why I like gunwook so much (he’s my bias in the group) because you can tell he’s actually intelligent and curious about things. He isn’t someone who navigates life indifferent. But yes, if you ever are feeling to delusional just keep in mind they’re just dancers and singers and their knees will be shot by the time they’re 40 years old likely.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
