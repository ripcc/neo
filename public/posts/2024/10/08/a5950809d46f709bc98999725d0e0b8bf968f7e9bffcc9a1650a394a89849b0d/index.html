Matthew is easier to style than Taerae though despite being shorter because his proportions are more typical and balanced. Gyuvin is just long everywhere and like yujin has one of the thinnest waists ever. Jiwoong has narrow shoulders proportionate to his head but they do pretty good with him, Ricky has a long neck but that isn’t too bad and Hao is pretty balanced. Gunwook is pretty balanced too but he has a wider rib cage and athletic build so they give him baggier pants which I don’t like 24/7. Also the stylists gotta get more creative with Gyuvin and dress him more mature. You got someone who has one of the rarest physiques out there, maybe experiment and stop dressing him in glorified preppy Adam Sandler core. I wanna see him in more trench coats, turtle necks, better hair styling, etc. Winter is coming so I’m hoping the cold weather means better layering and styling.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
