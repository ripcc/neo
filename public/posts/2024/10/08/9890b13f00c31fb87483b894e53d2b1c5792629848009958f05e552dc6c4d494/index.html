On average they’re at the minimum more likely to be superficial, at least looks wise. When everyone in the industry and your coworkers are a 9 or 10/10 and skinny or perfectly fit you’d probably create an unrealistic standard of beauty. Those that started young never had the time to make valuable mistakes (also they are in the public eye, they had to be extra cautious) so they probably lack emotional maturity, common sense, and genuine depth to understand how their mistakes can hurt others. Even the worst idols have devoted fans who console them even when they’re in the genuine wrong, so that’s also a bad thing because it dissuades accountability and gives a sense of confidence of always having support even if they mess up so they can be a little more careless. Ik we joke a lot about “oh I’d trust this idol with my drink” but I genuinely think I wouldn’t trust any male idol. Taeil was always a little weird but no one ever expected him to be a r*pist, you can’t trust men, especially Korean men (have you seen the insane misogynistic and incel statistics they have?).</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
