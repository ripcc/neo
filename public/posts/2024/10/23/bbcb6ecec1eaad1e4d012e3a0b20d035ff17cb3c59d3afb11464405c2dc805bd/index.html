I saw this in weibo. The rumor about Loewe dropping Hao because Yuehua offered Yibo and since Gucci China kinda like Hao, he was pitched for it. But it's so unfair. Yibo already got Chanel and many more big brands. Why go for Loewe? I didn't like Gucci for Hao. It's so boring. Goodness. Yuehua should have chosen other brands that are interesting like Balenciaga. Even LV has better desings than Gucci. ðŸ˜­</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

So that was probably always gonna go to yibo I don't too much about fashion tho</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
