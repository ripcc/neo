Her only potential downfall kside is her coke addiction lol.and when I was talking about Koreans I was talking about Lisa I still have trauma from when #they tried to sabotage her solo debut (which arguably sucked worse than mantra but did better .see the thing abt talent) I thought Jennie would do the best in Korea actually but roseanne dethroned her and Karina is the new it girl tbf. but fuck jisoo can't sing dance or act the fact that I have to wait for her flop album before I get an ot4 cbðŸ˜’</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

But ohhhhh yea they don't which is so sad Lisa begged korea for years and still gets no love pretty sure she does promotions there still when she has the least obligation to do so oh ðŸ˜« ur right rockstar did feel cheaper than mantra but I still like it better exactlyyyyyy but yea Jennie's time of taking over the internet is done she kinda killed it herself playing that untouchable mysterious part AND YUPPPPP FUCK JISOO TIMES TENNNNN I'm not even a blink I just don't like her</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
