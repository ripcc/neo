I'm guessing this is the subtext of the less unhinged criticism he's facing from k-fans, but I mean I can't blame i-fans for not picking up on that. Also I didn't type all this as a fan of him, and the people making him out to be a martyr are doing too much in the other direction as always, but yeah considering most people on the i-side especially are only privy to cherry-picked parts of his scandals, it's not surprising to see this convo re-surface and the scolds of both sides righteously ramp up. Also girl don't worry about word-vomiting, I genuinely appreciate it lol. I feel bad inundating people with my paragraphs I can't be brief and succinct for my life.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-15 02:45:17</small></header><p>yea when you consider the fact that he had scandal predebut then apologized more scandal afterward with the ig lives, bad stories, and the threat of exposing more then apologized and went on hiatus CAME BACK apologized and had more exposed. Its not even about the morality of his actions and the response hes a huge liability especially since his group directly benefitted from his hiatus and made feats he wasnt present for so really he shouldnt have been made to come back and all that wouldve been avoided but ifans think the things he got exposed for didnt matter so here we are. And no i didnt think you meant it in his defense lol it was a good discussion piece I like reading what yall gotta say i wish i could be more active so it could be more frequent</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
