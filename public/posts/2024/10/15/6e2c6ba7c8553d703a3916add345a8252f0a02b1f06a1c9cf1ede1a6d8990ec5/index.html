I want mattwook to be pushed too and I'm a mattwook truther plus I know haobin will be pushed as well because those 4 have the biggest core fandom in Japan but to be honest from a business stand point it'd be stupid as fuck not to push ricky as top 3, he has the most insane gp reach out of every body like we have to be honest, even if his core fandom isn't as big as those four pushing him is just good for the group. Our Japan fandom is big but gp reach is also so important and I'd rather grow then just cater to core fans if that makes sense.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Popularity in a country and I so badly want it and I'm surprised jfans haven't gotten crazy about it since they're some of the most popular members there CAN YALL GET TO FUCKING WORK 🤬 but no I get it pushing Ricky is smart I just need to have this business plan including them sowwyyyy 😂✌️</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
