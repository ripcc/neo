But I guess what I was getting at is that if you really think about it, it's not that crazy at all, because the kinds of things some of these idols are being taking down for (I know the Seunghan sitch is a little more complicated since i-fans are hyper-focused on the dating/sex stuff over everything else) are frequently things I don't think anyone, let alone a young person, can properly account for even with vigilant preparation and the fear of god instilled in them. I guess what rubs me the wrong way is how a failure to comply with kpop standards ("regular human things") is treated as a moral failure regardless of the severity of the act itself simply because being an idol is this covetable, powerful position (I'd argue it's not actually institutionally powerful, but I'm running out of steam) and thus it's always also implied they are committing the crime of taking their position for granted."</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
