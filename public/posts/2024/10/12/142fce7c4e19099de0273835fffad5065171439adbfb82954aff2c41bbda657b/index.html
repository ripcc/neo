There's this girl that was on that Katseye reality program that posted some of the songs they were practicing on her private instagram, and thanks to that the song got leaked, she got kicked out of the show and the people who watched the survival were like she was deserving of it and making fun of her for posting the songs on her priv. But then we have Seunghan who was posting choreos on his private instagram and the fans think that he didn't do anything wrong. For me, it's kinda silly to be posting all those things on social media when you know that even if it's your private there's always people who want to feel important that will probably brag about knowing songs or choreos from the new rookie group that a big company it's going to debut, do I think that they deserved getting kicked out? No. But the double standards of when an idol debuts vs when they don't it's funny.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
