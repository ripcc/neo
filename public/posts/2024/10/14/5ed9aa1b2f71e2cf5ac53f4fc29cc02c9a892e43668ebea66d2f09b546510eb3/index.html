Like something made that they had but not for runway. Someone mentioned it’s identical to the one xiao zhan wore just in a different colour so it’s possibly a different piece that was made for him and just not used. I only say this because a new custom suit for an event like this doesn’t seem likely, like it’s not even their own event or a big event and the suit didn’t fit him in the way you’d expect if it was custom made for him.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
