The problem is that ricky's gift box was officially sold on taobao, and only the sales that come from the specific link provided by the brand count in the total number of official sales. That's just how things in c-ent work and it's why cbars always urge fans to check if they're buying from the official store before confirming their purchase. There are people that take advantage of these situations and open links on taobao and other sites in the hopes that confused fans will buy from their links instead, and maybe that's what happened with ricky's gift box. But if that's the case, then his cbar shouldn't have included those unofficial sales. But then again, his cbar said they confirmed the numbers with the brand, so their statement about the sales should be legit...</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
