If they are leaving earlier maybe an schedule with the 3 of them, if they are leaving later maybe they wanted to explore Bangkok a little more (although they would only have 1 day more to explore but Hao rides for Thailand so maybe he convinced the others to stay for a bit more even if it's a short time).</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
