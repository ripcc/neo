Dang I really might be biased I enjoyed the zb1 stages because their mixes were so good and the stage direction for mama and mma were pretty alright the other award shows not as much they flopped on those sbs gayo djj was really fun too</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
