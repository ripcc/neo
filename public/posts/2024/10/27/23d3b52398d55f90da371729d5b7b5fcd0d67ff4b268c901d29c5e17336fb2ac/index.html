Chaeryeong and Yeji dancing is still better than hers. If she was on IVE she would also fall behind Yujin and Liz, maybe her dancing would save her but she would be a Gaeul 2.0 but with better dancing. If she was on Aespa, the vocal disparity between her and the others would be too much. Haerin and Hyein only have a nice tone, but so does Chaewon and that didn't save her from getting tore up.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
