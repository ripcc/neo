<small>2024-10-27 00:19:11</small></header><p>i agree hes complex i just mentioned the gamer thing as contrast since its always been a thing for fans to pick out a couple traits and make it a persona and thats really what people use to determine his sexuality i dont really mind what other ppl say that has nothing to do with me i was just asked on my reasoning and yup he matches energy pretty good i always find it funny when people are super convinced they know something we dont and its nothing major</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
