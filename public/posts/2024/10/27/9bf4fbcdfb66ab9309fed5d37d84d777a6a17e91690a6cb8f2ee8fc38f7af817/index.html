But idk if anything the one that was on her way to become the biggest one in the group has always been Miyeon, I actually think that if she was a better dancer and cube released a more cunty and fun song for her solo, she would've had a sk hit on her hands, but sadly she released a very boring album.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
