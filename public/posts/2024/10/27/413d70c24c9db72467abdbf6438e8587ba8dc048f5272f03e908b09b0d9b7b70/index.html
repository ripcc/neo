It's just that, his features aren't typical unlike the generic face that Hanbin has which is palatable. But Niki is seriously handsome. I saw a collage of enhypen with Hao where our twink is mogging everyone but at least Niki can keep up. Hanbin would definitely be more handsome in Korean standard but internationally, it's Niki.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
