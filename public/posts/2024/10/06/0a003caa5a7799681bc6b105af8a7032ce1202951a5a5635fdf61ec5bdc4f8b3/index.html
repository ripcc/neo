If he was a kisser I think he’d be the type to kiss, pull away and give a dummy smile and be proud of his work but then return, he’d be more of an average kisser but proud of himself) Ricky (I feel like he’d be too into angles or aesthetics to actually get down and dirty 😭 he’s probably be thinking “I look hella good in this angle” and make you tilt your head in a super uncomfortable angle to suit him 😭 he got nice lips though) Gyuvin (bro wouldn’t know what he’d be doing but would probably just like doing little pecks and get giddy, he’d be awkward with his long limbs and not know where to put himself or his hands, but it’d be cute and if you’re down to lead and teach he’d be fun)</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
