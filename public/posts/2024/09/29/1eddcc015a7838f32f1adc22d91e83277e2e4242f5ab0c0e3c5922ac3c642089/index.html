Gyuvin knew when to sing and I respect that at least he's really trying
Jiwoong... yeah he should lipsync the whole thing he's not good dhzjksllz
Ngl I don't want to be too harsh on him because I see the potential but yujin really doesn't try sgsjskls like there's songs where they barely move they're literally sitting down for goodnight and the only thing he sings live is the good night at the end lmaol</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

But period the ones who sing live less aren't dead weight and agree they sound better Ricky's def more stable and wow I might have to clap for gyuvin just last year he was smiling instead of singing a couple adlibs okay brothaaaa. I hate hate hate jiwoongs voice so yea I'd rather not hear it sound any worse than the studio version and eh yea maybe yujin will get there he used to not sing his lines at all so jdjfngjmdmksksks</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
