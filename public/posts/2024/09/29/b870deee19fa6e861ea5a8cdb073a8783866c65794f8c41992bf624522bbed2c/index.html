I also bookmarked some of her cc because it was so informative but I think this is the only one that anon missed and she gave us tea on aaa, I still wonder which member she was talking about on the plane incident. https://curiouscat.live/requeefiem/post/1345778003 Also she was talking about sklen here and I was curious because I haven't heard from her in awhile and checked her twitter and it's 'rest' ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ ricky really doesn't fuck with sasaengs at all and I guess she finally gave up aww ðŸ˜­ðŸ’”</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

The thing is tho shes been aware of ricky disliking her since almost last yr she just kept pursuing and then had a mental break somewhere down the line in may? i follow her on ig idek how i found it she had 8 followers ðŸ˜­ but she was holding on for a good while she just doesnt get what she wants from ricky she was honestly the more harmless ones just mentally ill</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
