We can't trust that this site will remain around and it's easier to backup by hand if you can search for the start of the comment before rather than links that won't work in the future. I was doing a backup of a CC w/ about 3k asks by just copying and pasting text to a plain document and even a few words is enough to differentiate comments to search for the parent comment someone was replying to. Unfortunately I don't know of any easier way because of how CC loads more asks and it's an infinite scroll instead of pages with distinct links</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
