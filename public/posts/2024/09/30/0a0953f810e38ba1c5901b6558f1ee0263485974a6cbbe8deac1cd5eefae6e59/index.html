There really hasnâ€™t been any update if his dad (it was his father that was sick I believe) has gotten better or not, but since then K-Soul has been on a hiatus for over 5 months and is promoting his solo album (his contract with Fantasy Boys label (PocketDol) allows him to has his own solo album even if it isnâ€™t through them so he isnâ€™t breaking any laws by doing so). His solo isnâ€™t tied to any other big label but rather a small group of people. Odds are he wonâ€™t return to Fantasy Boys since lord remembers the last time he was promoted on fantasy boys official and they havenâ€™t had a comeback in forever. The group is sending some of their members to another survival show either way coming up. Initially Fantasy Boys had a somewhat okay following even tho the show was horrendous (Iâ€™ve watched over 20 survival shows and it was the worst Iâ€™ve ever seen) because it aired on public cable, so it actually had higher ratings than Boys Planet. But Iâ€™d say 1/3rd of those that followed the show, even if their faves got in, stopped and quit the group because K Soul got in and because the ranking system made no sense. Also, itâ€™s one thing if he was talented and had his personality, like if he was Adele i feel like most people could ignore how he acts, but his singing is mediocre, he canâ€™t rap, his dance is ok but he canâ€™t make expressions, I think heâ€™s had too much work + botox done. He also hasnâ€™t once released a childhood photo despite the rest of his members doing so, and I believe itâ€™s because someone would research it and find out how old he is and see what work heâ€™s had done. For those that think Iâ€™m tripping, look up one of his fancams and look at how he moves his face. Itâ€™s somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
