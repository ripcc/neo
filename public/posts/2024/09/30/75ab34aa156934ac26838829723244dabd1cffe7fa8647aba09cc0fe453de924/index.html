This was when he missed aaa and he secretly went back to shanghai to renew his passport or something btw so no one knew he went but these bitches had the audacity to yell at him like that across tsa in front of everybody, I can't. Losing these physco sasaengs are a blessing especially earlier on imo since the 'delulu one sided relationship' aint that deep yet.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
