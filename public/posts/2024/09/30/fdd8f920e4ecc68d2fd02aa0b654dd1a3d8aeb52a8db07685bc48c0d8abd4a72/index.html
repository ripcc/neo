I don't even think she lives at the dorms often either because sometimes in airport arrivals when they come back from somewhere, 3 vans pick them up, 3 members go in one van, 2 members in another and wonyoung always goes alone.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I heard her one confirmed close friend is those chaebol daughter girl but that's it. But wow living at her own place is kinda crazy like I guess working since 13 gave her those life skills but also that seems kinda dangerous she's so so so popular and she's only 20 idk that would scare me</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
