Just to be able to properly anything without the fear of getting stoned🤕it’s probs worse for wdgs and haos sf tho. But one time I tweeted out to stop begging for tiktoks cuz we have literally gotten so many anecdotes from the members explaining why he doesn’t appear often and they still beg it like trust me if he wanted to show smth he would have ! I have no doubt the company has some weird restrictions on him in some way but between the pluschat messages and TikTok’s I don’t think that’s them! Sorry!, I said this and it was so funny cuz all my riyangi moots basically agreed w me and the comcensus was “yeah idrk why wakeone would habe any reason to sns ban him either….”</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
