I'm not sure what arrogance he has that he believes he can survive as an idol without singing. His major fanbases are fleeing, and his engagement is deteriorating day by day. His TWS peers and wishes are being recognized on a regular basis. I never read any nice comments about him on pannchoa English sire when he was discussed. He was once my bias, but not anymore. Frankly, he is becoming a disappointment with each passing day.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
