I mean, the anons from the linked posts say haobin go to couple spots and that everyone in the gcs knows or thinks they're together... so, if people in gcs know, surely the crazy ssngs who want to date them would too, no? If so, why haven't they aired their secret or left the fandom. Do they think they can steal hao or hanbin away from the other? ðŸ˜­ I don't get it.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
