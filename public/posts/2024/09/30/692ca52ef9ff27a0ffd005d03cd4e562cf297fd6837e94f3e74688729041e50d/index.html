But Gyurae still is only 15 now (I think) and like, it’s super concerning to think that him and the hairstylist still might be messaging each other because their company never stood up for him or made a comment saying they’d choose different stylists. He was also rank 2 on the show, and since rank 1 left and sued the company, you can argue Gyurae is their PO1. It’s very complicated and like the pressure on him has to be insane and the hair stylist needs to be locked up</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
