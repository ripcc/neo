<small>2024-09-28 08:06:01</small></header><p>I'll list it out by member jiwoong - go enlist brudda
hao - tbh my wish is lowkey him being a soloist in korea but that's near impossible a group is aight but i think it would more be fun exploring his sound
hanbin - not in a group or a soloist I think he should pursue dance and stay within in that mc presenter realm I don't think he suits variety but some kind of YouTube show idk
matthew - I'd want to see him in a group again I don't rlly see much when it comes to his future besides being in a group but my ideal would be redebuting with gunwook üòù
taerae - I don't think he should go solo yet I think about it and it could work but also I guess my dislike for evnne runs deep I wouldn't wish that on him but he's most likely going there. but if that sm trot group does well let's put him in the next one
ricky - I can see him being independent and trying to break into that social media and fashion world but I'm a fan and I'm selfish but also debuting in a group is iffy the only possibility I can think of is yuehuaz and well there's been no cult glazing including him so idk a part of me thinks he'd still wanna be an idol too idk
gyuvin - well he can go ahead and debut in yuehuaz that's really his dying wish but maybe he'll try to pursue some flop acting maybe end up like younghoon
gunwook - goatie... i have a 10 year plan play book for his future he's definitely going to be in a group and I have hope he'll leave yuehua my ultimate dream is redebuting with yujin and matthew but I would wanna see him tapping into ultimate artistry and producing his own solo music YEZGAWD HENNEY
yujin - i think he has the most potential and debuting with yuehua is likely and a good choice for him uhmm maybe he's even get bought out and do even better i think about his future the least tbh And in terms of management uh idk hopefully whatever they got is better than this and they can finally tap into things they're all tailored to and get good promo like wow even for the members I don't care ab lets shoot for better yall we don't have to be popular just make good money and do things u like uhhh and promo that matches well wow this too damn long</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
