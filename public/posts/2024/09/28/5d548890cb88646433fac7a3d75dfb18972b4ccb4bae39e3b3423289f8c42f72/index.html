Like I’ve liked her before her rampant sexualization and she’s changed so much. All idols are sort of viewed as meat, I understand that and that’s a cornerstone of the industry, but her case is just insane because they got porn actresses telling her she should think about joining the industry during a variety show. And the gross shots in Cignature’s MV. To be a women, with only a gross gooner fanbase, has to be so depressing, especially when your company is the one making you actively participate in things most idols don’t do. And you can tell she isn’t doing it because she likes it, she’s visibly uncomfortable. It’s just…. So sad :(</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
