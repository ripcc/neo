And agree yea there's huge differences between how they grew up they might not relate at all and since Chinas so huge there's so much diversity but as an American Ricky really does give American like if I didn't hear his slight accent I'd think he was born and raised. Oh and for tbz I think it came down to values and similarity moonbae were closer to each other than the two were with Eric</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
