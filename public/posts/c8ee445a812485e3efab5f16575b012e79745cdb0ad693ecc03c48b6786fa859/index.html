I don’t think he left anything else early I’m pretty sure it was just mma that he left like 1/4 of the way through and we were all confused where he went. Though considering she made the decision to shut the cafe (she said she might reopen on the future if her health improves) suggest it’s most likely a long term thing because if it was short term there would be no point in closing and re opening. Shutting seemed like she knew she wouldn’t be better for a while at least.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
