I can totally see Ricky under 88rising after this live ğŸ˜­ he got that american old school rnb vibe and I don't know if he practiced for it but hes obv highly influenced in the rnb genre so his singing style even in zb1 always gives rnb vibes plus his tone fits it so well. almost all the songs he played are old school rnb from like a decade ago I was shocked cause those are my jams but no one listens to old school rnb anymore which is a shame and even the korean ones like I need a girl by taeyang from like a decade ago ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ that song literally got me into kpop when i was 11ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ his song choices gave me so much nostalgia like damn i got emotional nd I give him big ups for not being embarrassed and listening to what he gen likes even if its old af cuz i know so many ppl wont listen to certain music simply cuz theyll get made fun of for it which is stupid af</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
