I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs evil but he constantly says things with no context or reasons (like the accent thing) that just fuels his sf up and makes the other members get lashed. Also I get he‚Äôs the center and main vocal but in all honesty if rosins expected every single song to be hao and friends then they should have just stanned a soloist, like another anon said this song was predominantly rap and hao isn‚Äôt a rapper at all so of course he wasn‚Äôt going to have much lines and yet he still had more than the groups main rapper.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
