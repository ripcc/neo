Hao just from the scene he was in pre debut and although it can be seen as being friendly just him trying to get into idols group chats was hilarious like he'll date for fun. Jiwoong well were assuming he just broke up and he seems okay like he's moved on, he's back to flirting and making music so he'll be in a relationship in no time.
4-6. Hanbin Taerae and Gunwook they give 4-5 relationships before busting out the ring for that special one.
7-9. I feel like these three would probably have 2 or even 1 relationship their entire life.
Gyuvin seems dumb but he can be serious when he means it and he seems like the type to take relationship seriously.
Matthew gives loves at first sight and would do anything to save the relationship never giving up.
Ricky surprisingly if you asked me 1 year ago I'd put him first/ second just from his first impression but getting to know him he seems the most committed as well, he really seems to knows what he wants and is really careful who he lets in his personal life hence why he has only a few friends and he's completely fine with that.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
