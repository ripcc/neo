Hao wants to get better at Korean and speak it without an accent but this show is only full of foreigners learning Korean from all different ethnic background with their own accents so it's only gonna hinder Hao because now he has to listen to Korean spoken with a thai accent, korean spoken with an english accent, korean spoken with a japanese accent etc, OH. MY. GOD. I knew it was a scheme all along it was too good to be true, it's wakeones evil plan now Hao can never speak Korean like a native ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ Wakone is purposely putting him on this show to bombard him with all other accents ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± Let's mass email wakeone tomorrow at 9am kst we can't let him on this show!</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
