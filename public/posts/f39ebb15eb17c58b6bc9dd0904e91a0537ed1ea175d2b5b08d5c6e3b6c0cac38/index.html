I've seen some Japanese accounts showing proofs that they voted for Taerae just so they can speak up about the FBs doing all the promos for Taerae's which they didn't do for Hao's and ZB1 marketing reason is that they didn't do individual voting before to avoid SF war because another member was nominated when Hao was the only one nominated that time. And Zeroseville not talking about this and call out the FBs is just promoting the narrative that Zeroses don't care about Hao the way they do with other members. It's just saddening to see this happen with how much Hao contributed in ZB1.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
