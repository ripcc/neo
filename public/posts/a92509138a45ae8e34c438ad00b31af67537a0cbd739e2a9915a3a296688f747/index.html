Let's just say the group is put on pchat ban because of supa and Gunwook showing his support at least there's a 'reason' but what's the reason for Ricky's one year ban that they're calling it? One year ban for that live where he went live without asking? Are they that stupid? What about all the times he did come? Was he briefly unbanned or what? They said Wakeone only let's him go on pchat for his endorsements well that was in September and he came plenty of times before then and even after, he came without talking or mentioning his endorsements, did he mention them a few days ago talking about the Japanese food he ate? And that's such a stupid excuse because he only mentioned uniskin ONCE. And exactly if he was banned why did he come onto pchat to talk about his hair at 6am because he finally had something new and exciting to talk about like they can't be serious and why we will never take them seriously because they ignore everything else and we see past their bs. Sorry for you sane riyangis who have to deal with them but yeah most of us are just joking at their stupidity and most of us here surprisingly like and accepted Ricky for who he is which is so ironic</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
