Jiwoon that guy from p7 is definitely in the l1ve, not so sure on junwon. Can’t say how I know for sure but he definitely is. Also anons bought up the point about the casting director not following him but look at what happened when she was publicly supporting hanbin, akgaes said there was an in appropriate relationship there all because she supported him. They are definitely aware of this too because she removed like all traces of zb1 off her account so I imagine they aren’t making any trainees public till they actually debut now.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
