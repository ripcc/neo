I just hate that jwg gets to waltz into a normal relationship w gwk after ignoring him for a year straight UGH GWK WATCH YOUR PURSE BAE</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
