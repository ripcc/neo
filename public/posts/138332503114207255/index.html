I even saw people in dc being more angry about wk1 not replying than about Hanbin losing the china personal schedule. They are like if the schedules don't match, at least reply that he can't do it. From what they were talking about I think it is a pictorial. Some of them are even going "compensate with a korean pictorial at least".... These girls don't really care about the offer but more about how the company is incompetent, and hanbin(or any member) could've lost more because of them not replying.... Also, I remember something like this happened with hao bar too</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

But itâ€™s one thing to decline or try and find a better date and a completely other to accept the offer but then ghost the organisers especially when they have waited up to two months and are still willing to work with him. Itâ€™s not so much loosing the schedule thatâ€™s the issue this time around itâ€™s how itâ€™s been handled and the negative impact that can have for hb because heâ€™s never had a job in China before and to accept and ghost his first one like this is not grossly unprofessional it people talk and I mean tbh itâ€™s extremely lucky that even after 2 months they still want to work with him after getting ghosted for so long.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
