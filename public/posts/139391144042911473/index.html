The buildings there are gorgeous. It's super overpriced compared to the rest of China though. There's bougie food but their cuisine is very sweet and gentrified. It's not that the shanghainese food is bad, it's just not as flavorful as the rest of china. It was a port city so there's a lot of western influence. Shenzhen Ê∑±Âú≥ - comparatively no fun places and shanghai is more "high-tech" the high-tech is such a bubble because it's a worker city so people don't care about recreation, huaqiangbei was cool to see and you can get cheap bootleg electronics but that's it, the food is mid as fuck, just boring don't go there Hangzhou Êù≠Â∑û - Hangzhou has a really beautiful west lake with willow trees and lotus flowers that you can take a car around, there also pretty silk scarves to buy, that's pretty much all though I thought the food was mid too, very modern though and has a really big tech scene because of being alibaba's hq, I think Suzhou ËãèÂ∑û is nearby and also has gorgeous scenery and good reviews though (1/3)</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
