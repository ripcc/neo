Even if he didn't do any of those things, people who don't know rk but know/ moots of that fake fob clout chasing groupie of his would automatically assume he does the same thing just because he chills with them once in a blue moon and not even by choice since its seems like it's family friend gatherings and that's how rumors start. im saying this because this hits home and something similar happened with me, during the holidays my parents would bring me to their friends house for parties and I had no choice but to hang with the teens around my age cause all the adults hung out together so it's just weird like I don't need to be babysat and because I was in some of their photos there were rumors of me 3 towns away that I did crack because two of them did ðŸ˜­ & that's how rumors start from peeps u don't even know in different towns and I only found out cuz my school had a volley ball tournament at one of their schools and some random whos friends with the person I 'know' at that party was like I heard you do crack with so and so ðŸ˜­. These parties where ur forced to chill with peeps cuz of ur parents are the worst cuz that's were all rumors start cuz nobody knows anyone so ppl gossip and wonder how they know each other & reading how horrible that groupie is it wouldn't surprise me if they were the ones starting rumors cuz they sound hella salty</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
