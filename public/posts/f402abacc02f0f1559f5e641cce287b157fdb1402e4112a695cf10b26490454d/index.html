I see a lot of people saying how good the budget is but it looked pretty cheap to me for some reason especially with the sets. The editing and the mysterious two worlds concept also reminded me of zb1’s first concept trailer they released for yits. I guess it depends on the music now which tbl is handling</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I'm really just a bitter oldhead cuz we really had to take a full year of shit just to get here AND THEY GET TO HAVE IT OMGGGGGGGGGGG but they might have a really good song man.. why can't everyone suffer like us</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
