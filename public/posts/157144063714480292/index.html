Like it’s been 2 years… Hao talking about them on a day to day basis like hb laying down flooring in his room but never deciding on it or Hao yelling at 2binz cause he wants to sleep or Hao calling out Hanbin for cussing while playing games or Hanbin making Hao eat his durian outside and Hao manipulating Hanbin by taking off his clothes so hb will let him eat inside… like yes tell me about you guys arguing over little shit because that’s real. Tell me about how despite fighting a lot, you’re still closest to each other.
Seeing hao say on salon drip that when he was trying to nap and 2binz were yelling while playing games he got angry and yelled “LET ME SLEEP” and slammed the door. And Hanbin and him laughed about it. Like I eat that shit up.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
