Anyway they were mad at that but then clocked it was the same account that said it was a hanbin fan who told Matthew to move at khan and then later confirmed it was actually gyuvin fan but wouldnâ€™t delete the og post. Then people clocked how they post every zb1 duo but Mattbin (so people just clocked that user doesnâ€™t like hanbin) kinda like how mono will post every Gunwook duo but mattparkz ðŸ’€ like it ainâ€™t slick. The whole Matthew debut because of hanbin wasnt anything to do with actual bp but more so if he hadnâ€™t convinced him to join he would have gone back to Canada ect. I guess they used it this time because they mentioned it recently.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
