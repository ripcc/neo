(idk what other word to use cuz this is definitely not that serious to say this lol) because they're majority new kpop fans so it didn't translate well. but they're right when you put it into perspective zbwon are technically the produce bg after wannaone which is so crazy to think about THEY REVIVED SOMETHING IN KPOP THAT WE HAVENT SEEN IN AGES AND THEY MAKE THE MOST SAY THATTTTTTTT everyone's been taking a piece of their nachos and we're gonna see big4 trying their method once they're gone</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/146292812944727384 class=replyLink>/+r/146292812944727384</a>boy group sales have inflated across the board, everybody's sales are ballooning because of kpop waste culture. the only reason zb1 is breaking those records is because they're the latest mnet boy group. wakeone didn't do anything special with the and as a matter of fact hardly marketed them at all, which is why nobody knows them in korea. that's the problem with bgs nowadays. it's all artificially big sales numbers, no cultural relevance. zb1 is really just benefitting from CJ and mnet privilege</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
