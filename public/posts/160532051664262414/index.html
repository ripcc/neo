I guess the company provided them with basic necessities but that sounds like a prison sentence and how were they surviving during their hiatus... they're probably from fortunate backgrounds but that's insane</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160468877669782268 class=replyLink>/+r/160468877669782268</a>Maybe it's one of those cases where they had a lot of trainee debt and yuehua was like "you'll pay us back with the money you make from your activities"?? everglow debuted in 2019 and were in a 20 month hiatus that ruined their momentum which was yuehua's own fault... but it's still so weird. Can't the girls sue? I feel so bad for them. If the trainee debt theory is true, then the Tempest boys probably don't get anything either. Yena, Ricky, Gyuvin, Hao, and Yujin should be ""fine"" because the izone/zb1 money should've been enough to pay all their debt by now, but I'm not sure about Seungeon and Yunseo. Is Evnne doing well?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-03-19 00:18:26</small></header><p>the thing is everglow were fairly popular and they tour often so I believe they've made the money back + if they're mostly from rich families they're not accumulating as much debt. I think it's just the case of a shitty company that's rlly it lmao, my friend told me wannaone had to beg to get paid and look how popular they were</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
