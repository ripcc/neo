Exam period and you sit that exam and if you pass you get a bachelor’s degree. My understanding is that this is completely separate from his DIMA degree because he’s already finished and graduated that. But yeah not just for him but to legally practice as a psychologist in most countries including kr you’d need a masters and then a doctorate if your going into specific roles. Even a counsellor would need a masters. It’s a good degree to have though, it teaches alot that can be self applied and make you more self aware also idol life aside its a good degree for people who want to go into hr/ marketing / management so I guess you could say it’s a good thing to have / be studying as a leader /+r/159018412079798929</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Even tho my undergrad is a science and there is some semi overlap especially in topics like cognitive psychology there’s no way I’d be able to study and understand most of the psychological concepts on my own /+r/159023913567998786</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And right self studying a uni degree sounds suicide inducing esp smth that's probably veryyyy new to him and being an idol it's crazy</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
