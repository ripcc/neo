Personally I think she's just an obsessive troll who is mostly all talk on the internet I doubt she has the guts to hate on hao to his face but I get why people are mad that she applied to his special stage if she has that history of hating him and was dumb enough to get caught doing it again /+r/158748100125745151</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
