Then during crush era Wonyoung said his young and rich line too which I think we all agree by now that yes that quote existed before him but she clearly said it because of him because she added the extra 'faboulous jang wonyoung' like his 'charisma boss ricky' at the end. Like this didn't start from schizo tiktokers slow mo ship edits, Wonyoung said the line herself and multiple times so I think ppl just been keeping an eye out whenever something similar happens I mean I would too ðŸ‘€ /+r/159029813116622075</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
