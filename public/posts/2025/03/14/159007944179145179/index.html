Also hanbin getting jaejoongs personal number was so funny to me like yes let‚Äôs slide a good word in brother üôèüèª I also found it interesting jaejoong himself mentioned how he thinks they are so similar because I always thought it but then finding out they are the same blood type, mbti, from the same province too was funny /+r/158739456483090063</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

The original premise is for jaejoong to make friends in the industry which makes more sense when you know his history and being blacklisted. The fun episodes are him reconnecting with old colleagues but it got popular so when younger idols come on it turns into a counseling session lol hanbin is definitely the type he likes though like the sociable extroverted types /+r/158748918795164869</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
