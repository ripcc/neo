A lot of 3rd gen ex-nugu gg members usually end up getting married to a wealthy man, try to make it as a influencer or just work part time trying to switch careers. And they always bring up debt as the reason they never do music again. /+r/160517951630561674</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
