Can't the girls sue? I feel so bad for them. If the trainee debt theory is true, then the Tempest boys probably don't get anything either. Yena, Ricky, Gyuvin, Hao, and Yujin should be ""fine"" because the izone/zb1 money should've been enough to pay all their debt by now, but I'm not sure about Seungeon and Yunseo. Is Evnne doing well? /+r/160468877669782268</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I think it's just the case of a shitty company that's rlly it lmao, my friend told me wannaone had to beg to get paid and look how popular they were</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>These are good numbers, no? https://x.com/ForeverOnCharts/status/1785870483025440849 /+r/160532051664262414</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
