<small>2025-03-21 00:17:09</small></header><p>https://mond.how/requeefiem our new home 😖 after trying it out its actually a very good alternative! only differences being the jarring ui, BUT i think the freedoms and extra features are worth the move. Ill be remodeling my rentry and page here so I can just have it up as an archive Im closing the ask box too ghfdjfhbdjsd CUZ WE ARE LEAVING TODAY!!! sorry to be pushy but its just pressing to force the move now, if you wanna quote smth copy the link and ask ab it on mond. To the anons that dont like making accounts you dont have to so dont worry about all that! Theres also a search feature on there plus the bookmark feature like the tea is there.. and dont even get me lit about the proper blocking function the access annoying ppl have on ns has gone one for too long! all in all just trust me on this choice i dont want ppl yelling at me for a month until they decide theyve gotten comfortable 😒</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
