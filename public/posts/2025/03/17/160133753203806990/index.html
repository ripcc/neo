The account actually looks sus imho. the bibigo kr Instagram is their only social listed. the account being created june 2024 and only started posting Feb this year with who made this post and following bunch of hanbin fans while bibigo usa is following influencers, doctors, restaurants and businesses like a proper business account is kinda the takeaway /+r/160118615654489362</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Anon you need to stop making out like there’s been some long standing connection there when there literally hasn’t because you do realise for the idea of an allin being behind that account to be feasible you’d have to be suggesting that on a random day in 2024 a random allin decided to make a bibigo account and then not tweet or follow anything about hb until March 2025 in an elaborate plan to engagement bait. Do you realise how sillly that sounds /+r/160126605040246080</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
