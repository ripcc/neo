I feel like everyone on here knows that but it's still weird for zerocolas to dig for stuff or cross boundaries since he'll tell them what they want to hear even without the leading questions. Like asking him what he would do if his phone gallery got hacked is crazy work that's when I feel for the dude. Two things can be true at once, he's good at feeding shippers and the questions are getting weirder /+r/160128297517404787</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I've seen other kpop groups and the staff would immediately try to end the conversation/interaction when the fan starts getting weird and that's also why these weird interactions never come from kfans ehhh it's just sad atp /+r/160133335501462805</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
