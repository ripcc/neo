I think it's confusing to people in countries that don't have it but it's an alternate way to get a bachelors. that's probably why he's taking extra language classes too like it's helpful to his idol career but foreign language is also a subject on the national exam /+r/159522748073464813</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
