His talent doesn't align with his mindset. As a singer or actor, yes. But as an idol? Bro literally said he got ambition but no greed. Sweet summer child you need at least a spoonful of greed to stay relevant. He is a business student he should've known each industry has different approach. Bro can't stay playing a little happy family and rationalizing everything he got to the point his fans also catch the same disease. Lil bro signed into the wrong industry and geonppangdans did not help at all with them having mass good girl syndrome and saying yes to whatever comfort Gunwook gave them.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
