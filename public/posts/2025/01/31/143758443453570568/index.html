F4 fans especially kr ones mostly hate on gw. They are his biggest haters in kr (those lowlife who only worship visual they talk about face more than talent). There was an era around debut when gpds collectively having trust issue towards those who call F4 as F4 because majority are gw haters but some were trying to hide and delete the trace after the final. Thank goodness jp star creators are sane they love talented charming people, they are the main reason gw can debut (love you japan, maybe gw should try a career there). Also around debut era maknae line fans shading eo quite much. Gv fans are salty because ifans keep saying en garde is gw song despite gv being first onsite, yj fans are salty because inter potential fans wish gw is the maknae for the group to have someone worthy of golden maknae title, gw fans salty because f4 especially maknae line bias in kr and cn keep targeting gw because that was the only region they could get some protection and gw was weak specifically on those two region. Thank goodness hyung line fans win the toxic fans olympic or else the fight still continue til this day /+r/143507844480850565</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
