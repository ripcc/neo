Two members of the winning group are under pocketdol/mbk ent. (probably the shittiest company rn in the industry/they have a few groups but most currently known is BAE 173.). One of the BAE 173 guys made it into the group alongside a trainee from the company. Group name is CLOSEYOUREYES (CYE). Recently the company controlling CYE posted on their groups official social media that two contestant‚Äôs company was preventing them from knowing where two of the CYE members are, that said alleged company was trying to force a member of CYE to cross promote with their original group during their time in CYE (they didn‚Äôt say the exact name but they were talking about pocketdol cuz basically Hangyul from BAE 173 is doing stuff rn too for BAE 173 despite just making it into the Starlight Boy‚Äôs survival show wining lineup ‚ÄúPolarix‚Äù and they were essentially expecting the BAE 173 guy that made it into CYE to do the same) and that they (CYE‚Äôs company) was going to report the two trainees as missing. PocketDol essentially puts out a response that says ‚Äúno we didn‚Äôt kidnap them also they‚Äôre our trainees we can use them however we want lol‚Äù. Then more statements or comments come out basically subtweeting each other in increasingly antagonistic jargon. The PD OF PROJECT 7 POSTS AN ADOLF HITLER QUOTE ON INSTA THAT SAYS ‚Äúif you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed‚Äù AND PUTS ‚Äúfuck evil‚Äù IN THE CAPTION. Some contestants from project 7 that didn‚Äôt make it likes the post. Keep in mind that PocketDol has done this before with Chaeyeon from I.O.I. (forced her to promote with her group DIA while also promoting with I.O.I. (the first group thay came out of the Produce survival shows), which ended up causing her to sit out big I.O.I. events and actually caused a huge wave of hate towards her not being devoted enough to her actual popular group).</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
