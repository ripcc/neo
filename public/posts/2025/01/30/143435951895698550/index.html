Personally I also hate them but at the same time I'm also thankful. Do you know what would happen if my sf don't have these crazies? Gunwook fandom. Always cater to ot9, always protecting ot9 over their own, when someone said they would regret their choice to okay-ing these ot9s over their own they proudly say their bias gonna be proud of them for prioritizing his teammates, now look at where they are and look at what happen to their bias. No job, no line, none of these ot9 who scream about stop sexualizing gunwook, stop protesting about him, stop asking for more just wait patiently, stop making things bigger than they are, other members need us ot9 more than him right now bla bla bla care to spend even some minutes to stream for him or promote him. How can you trust when the result of trusting ot9s is right in front of our eyes? /+r/142709968070726670</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
