(why would it take him 7 months to realize this.) there's absolutely nothing in my room right now. just the floor. (⁉️⁉️⁉️) so when the bed gets here, i'll decorate the room nicely.” How can someone who seems to shop a lot live in a room for almost 2 years and still have no personal belongings in there. Like look at the other members rooms you can tell that they live there no one else has an empty room omfg it makes no sense</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

We gotta rmbr they don't spend most of their time in rooms like regular people they're always traveling and working so there's not gonna be personal belongings and especially if half of a shared room was cleared out rky is type B downnnn he's not decorating 😭</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
