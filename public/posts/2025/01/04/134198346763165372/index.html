Basically saying the more snow ducks you make the better, in fact make an entire flower bed full of them.

ASDFSEAKFJSA;KJFA;S and it's really popular in Korea, a lot of kids, teens and even adults make them on the way home and you can find snow duck molds in every convenient store also the wording he used he just sounds like a typical uneducated hannam incel so they're also jumping him for that. /+r/134019602014492205</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
