If Ricky wanted to be part of it and wakeone rlly did control whoâ€™s in every specific TikTok do you think theyâ€™d srsly exclude him for no reason?????? They srsly donâ€™t know him at all like heâ€™s so obviously just keeping to himself rn so to basically force him to post TikTokâ€™s and do all this dumb stuff he dgaf about is so stupid</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>Otto</strong>
