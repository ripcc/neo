It’s not like it’s only 1 or 2 zb1 members and the gap would be too big to be understandable like it would just make more sense to keep those 6. /+r/141688986061200930</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-01-26 02:34:18</small></header><p>Yea unless they have another yujin hiding somewhere they're not gonna reconstruct a brand new group for yuehuaz. I can see them adding two trainees and dropping yunseo tbh like he's not a gag and at least seungeon is needed. This makes me think of junhyeons group I forgot the name but he's no longer the most popular member the new kid beat everyone out cuz he's a visual and a singer so if they have someone like that it wouldn't be too bad</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
