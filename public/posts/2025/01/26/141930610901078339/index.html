Idgaf about plastic surgery but i just think hanbin lost a bunch of weight which can change one's looks drastically, and hao has always had fuller lips, he's just been overlining them af. Ik overlining the lips became a huge thing in 2024 in korea, aespa's giselle was in soo many videos abt how this "trend" gave her a glowup. Again i really dgafðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ even if they did get plastic surgery i think they look amazing and fans always say the two of them look great irl so i guess props to the surgeons if they were involved</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Tbh this topics really old like 2023 ancient there's a consensus and they have got a bunch of work done but it doesn't matter it's not an uncommon for idols and they look better than their peers like nobody rlly cares</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
