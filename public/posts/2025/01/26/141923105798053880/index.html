He’s lucky tho that he lost it all young because while his skin is stretchy he doesn’t have loose skin that most people do who lose a lot of weight later in life because the skin still holds a lot of collagen till around 25 ish then it gets harder to get rid of excess skin /+r/141688356500363319</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
