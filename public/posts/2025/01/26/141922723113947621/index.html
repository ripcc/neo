And there was massive speculation that Gucci ancora in China was only supposed to be hao which lowkey checks out now because Ricky‚Äôs the only member who went to that event that‚Äôs never been sponsored by Gucci since or gone to one of their events. It really wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if it took so long because yuehua wanted it to be a Luckyz thing esp since it‚Äôs a China schedule and that‚Äôs where they have a lot of power. Also funny to bring it up at this time because there‚Äôs actually a pic going round of hao using a yuehua staff phone and the case is Luckyz zeroninis üòÇ /+r/141696390446405940</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
