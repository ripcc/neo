I wouldnâ€™t care if they were just complaining at the company but they always wanna pull hanbin into it like they arenâ€™t different situations. Hanbin has missed mca for group schedules itâ€™s just less likely to happen because whoâ€™s booking big schedules for a weekday, it just doesnâ€™t happen. Then they want to go on about how they donâ€™t fly out on Thursday and always Friday but Iâ€™m sorry even when mca was cancelled and zb1 was still flying out for tour over winter brokeone was still making them fly out on Friday rather than pay for an extra day in the hotel like they are flying out the day before regardless of hanbin having an mc schedule or not. And the biggest distortion yet is that wakeone is the biggest source of Yujin missing his mc schedules. Like wakeone is shit from the butt but if you look at the list mulbokdans made themselves of when and why he missed mc schedules, aside from some tour dates and award shows most of him missing it came from sbs cancelling inkigayo anyway ðŸ˜­ Kwave recording 02/06/24 (sbs show inkigayo cancelled ) Kwave broadcast 02/06/24 (sbs show, inkigayo cancelled) Hi touch in Japan 14/15 /07/24 Sbs gayo 21/07/24 (sbs show inkigayo cancelled) Kcon LA 28/07/24 Sbs gayo replay 04/07/24 (sbs show inkigayo cancelled) Summer sonic in Japan 18/04/24 Krazy concert 15/09/24 Seoul tour stop 22/09/24 Singapore tour stop 29/09/24 Bangkok tour stop 06/10/24 Inkigayo Tokyo 13/10/24 (sbs show inkigayo cancelled) Inkigayo Tokyo replay 24/10/25 (sbs show inkigayo cancelled) Jakarta tour stop 27/10/2024 Macau tour stop 03/11/2024 Mama Japan 24/11/2024 Japan tour stop 01/12/2024 Inkigayo cancelled because of political situation 08/12/2024 Kms song festival in Japan 24/12/2024 Inkigayo cancelled for winter break 22/12/2024 Inkigayo cancelled for winter break 29/12/2024 Golden disk awards 05/12/2025 Zb1 filming something in Bangkok 19/02/2025</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
