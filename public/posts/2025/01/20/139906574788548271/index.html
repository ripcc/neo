Like ofc something like 2 seconds (figuratively) in a 3min song is crazy but the genuine crash out I watch some people have in this fandom over their bias not having the most when they are consistently at the top is outstanding to me. This isnâ€™t just about todays issue in particular but I always think about this, especially when zerose start to go on coke rants about X deserves more lines, ok then who do you propose we take lines away from them. Because lines arenâ€™t limitless, some people will get less and some people will get more but Iâ€™m not about to throw a pity party for someone who consistently gets more when the whole fandom starts tweaking out and insinuating any of the others should have had less.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Like if everyone's lines are getting cut.. THEN WHOS SINGING tbh it's always the same fandoms complaining like there's maybe 2 that don't complain they try to but it's nothing crazy ðŸ˜­ I never take the discourse serious because nothing will ever change it's not the lines it's zeroses</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
