I searched Hao's name yesterday to look for repos for the handshake event and one of his fans posted about not seeing many older women and she was nervous because it's her 1st time without her circle of friends. Her daughter is a Ricky fan and I think she's around 40yo. Another one is an older woman too with her husband (they are so sweet ðŸ˜­) and a Hanini plushie is hanging on her bag. I want to grow old like them. ðŸ˜­ I remember during the concert, Jzeroses are posting their kids attending with them. Lots of Hao fans carrying Haninis. I envy Japan because they arent discriminating fans because of their age like what international fans are doing. You know, the "you're pushing 30 blah blah blah..."</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
