I wouldn’t say he had the full responsibilities of their performance director but it’s really clear wakeone was under prepared in many aspects to take on zb1 and really just used his back group to try and quickly fill a gap he shouldn’t have had to fill tbh /+r/142087040635460241</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
