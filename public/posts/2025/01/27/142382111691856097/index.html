Anyway I don’t think the outrage was about the role specifically but more at the general sentiment of why did wakeone have no staff for them at debut and have a member doing something they should have had hired staff for. Nothing new in terms of knowledge for here but suprisingly there are a lot of new zerose who don’t know how bleak debut era was /+r/142343526397730205</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

OUUUIE IT WAS TURRIBLE but this just makes me think majority of the active fans are new zang like this might be the only place where its mostly old fans</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
