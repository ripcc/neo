I don't know about the other produce group treatment from their peers but iirc sejeong shared about her not being respected they way she was with ioi when she debuted with gugudan tells a bit about how these survival groups seen by non survival groups.
Call me delulu but I also feel like the other idols trying to do what zb1 do, copying them hoping to get the same hype
