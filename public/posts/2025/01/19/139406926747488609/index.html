Gunwook said every member got good satisfying parts, so I assume everyone got similar amount of lines that could showcase their singing, even the ones who are bad at singing. I know some don't deserve it but still it could be encouraging for the members who've always had the least lines.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
