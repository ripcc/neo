So PocketDol is now defaming the BAE 173 guy that made it into CYE (legit released a statement today basically accusing him of not being faithful to BAE 173 and not doing his activities, tldr: saying heâ€™s irresponsible and a shitty worker and they also said he wasnâ€™t keeping promises with BAE 173â€™s fandom) and the other trainee from PocketDol, Kenshin, his dad posted on Instagram a picture of 11:11 (Angel numbers?) captioning it that everyone should pray together that the whole group can debut as one. The Project 7 producers also came out saying that all companies knew (and possibly signed off maybe?) before they sent everyone to the show that no trainee that would win would be allowed to cross promote. Parents are now hopping into the drama and PocketDol has started defaming their own artists. So, to sum it up, we got an abusive company trying to force cross promotion, holding another trainee from the same company that made it in as hostage, several legal questions regarding contract law, a Hitler quote, company defamation towards their own artists, desperate parents, and more ðŸ˜­</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
