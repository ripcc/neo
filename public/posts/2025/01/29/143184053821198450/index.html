Like from what Iâ€™ve seen of your responses you probably think they are together but that doesnâ€™t mean you care to put your energy and time into them. You just know their tea from other sources.
Secondly even though ik itâ€™s a broken record, I find it super funny when some anons like this one come here pressed trying to claim woonghao/myungbin are together because of some little fanservice moments compared to everything off cam/privately Haobin haveâ€¦ Iâ€™m not gonna type out why Ik Haobin are genuinely real cause thereâ€™s literally no point and I can do that elsewhere. But bringing ships like myubin/wnghao here all upset like be so fr. /+r/140865178123326527</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I find it so interesting that haobinists never talk about how hanbin only ever mentions gyuvin when he talks about the member he turns to when he's having a hard time, the one who's always helping him and being there for him, how he's always suggesting other members kiss each other including hao and so much other shit that I won't even get into like damn if they were fr dating that shit is embarrassing asffffff. Tbh us normal stans/ non haobinists really don't care if they're dating or not all the ships are the same to us the only thing that gives these haobinists the nerve or the confidence is because both of them gay and play into that ship fanservice a lot. Ur also no different (even worse) than delusional gf stans or antis/akgaes who say they hate each other the way you keep trying to make it sound like some gospel truth unknown to everyone but yourselves when u get ur "resources" from sasaeng content and misinformation girl PLEEZ ur on the same internet as everyone else and ur a fan just like everyone else u aren't their friend. u sound corny as hell we been in kpop for a while and we know how most kpop popular ships end.
I'd like to see ur reactions fr when they no longer acknowledge each other after disbandment LMAOOO
Anyway sorry for the rant I just needed to whack haobinists for a sec because they've been irking me for a hot minute especially talking shit about other ships ðŸ˜‚ (normal shippers this isn't about y'all) /+r/143072307076881182</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
