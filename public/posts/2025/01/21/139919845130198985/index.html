I think that’s an interesting difference I’ve noticed (before anyone says anything please don’t think I’m saying any sf is good both allins and rosins are devils) but rosins if mad will stop streaming and vote the opposition ect in retaliation even if it goes against what their bias says while allins will still at least actively vote and stream and their whole basis is its what hanbin wants. I do find that difference in mindset interesting even though both sf are similar in many other aspects /+r/139915097081601712</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
