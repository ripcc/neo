Dpmo, gtfo,stop being an idol and go home.
even if i have a hundred brothers to fight for i will still try to take the fortune, if you like the stage so much then perform at the year end party of the company your dad is the president of, imagine giving up everything to be a kpop idol, man thes rich kids really grow up with no sense, i can't understand</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And most idols are rich we rlly don't care tbh</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>? Anon u too woke and this makes no sense ur blaming him for something he has no control in as in being born in a rich family.... and to be honest I find it admirable and respect him more knowing he comes from a background of wealth but willingly dropped all that to pursue his dreams. He could of easily had it easy in cali but left to korea alone and trained like everyone else equally. #IDidntKnowIdolsAreOnlyForBrokeBitches like wdym go home??! Anon you sound so insecure and honestly seems like you're projecting something so get that shit fixed and stop blaming someone else for your own failures. /+r/139907291880313450</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
