His lips don't have bad migration tho so there's that</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>his lips are always plump like that, it just give the plumper effect because of overlining and he pouts a lot like the teaser, tbh the discussion didn't bother me that much but seeing your anons keep talking about the way his lips changed that much made me chuckle, the overlining is so obvious in this picture because you can see his lipstick is out of the lines of his lips https://x.com/haotexts/status/1875902708169023834 /+r/138859701294289311</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
