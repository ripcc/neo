If the MCs and some members hadn't pushed themselves too hard, the atmosphere would have been so bad that it would have been impossible to continue. It's not that they're doing badly because they're rookies, but it's like they were dragged out of a public place against their will. I was looking forward to seeing the members for the first time in a long time, but I was embarrassed the whole time. I think from next time, only the members who want to appear should appear” and then a kgpd qrt then mentioning hanbin and then it just tunred into burner accounts going back and forth and dying off into personal insults. Tbh I’m still not sure what the issue actually was, no one on the I side said anything even the akgaes so I guess it’s died over there now. /+r/140869963996157005</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I've only seen clips and aside from myngj dick riding the extrovert members made it fun so I don't get it are they blaming gwk and tartar im assuming cuz their fans jumped in 😭 I hate only seeing the aftermath cuz that's what I saw but yea probably an in the moment thing you'd have to understand. I saw one and only one alln akgae hop in and they were just calling zbwon shitty actors so I'm not sure</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>Actually after digging into it most of it got deleted because it seemed to be silly back and forth between burners rather than anything serious and I didn’t see any kkul mad about hanbin asking Taerae to do random dance but if they did again that super unserious since it was in the segment where they were all having fun and doing random rap verses /+r/140896534068941226</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
