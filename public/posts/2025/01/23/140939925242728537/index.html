These girls need to learn to smile. From the kgpd thing I donâ€™t think anyone had an issue with gw in the first place like k side and I side no one was saying anything (neg) about him but that one gpd burner randomly jumped on hb so they retaliated with their own burners. Idk why they jumped in tbh because no one was saying anything about gw. /+r/140898256413743423</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
