If the MCs and some members hadn't pushed themselves too hard, the atmosphere would have been so bad that it would have been impossible to continue. It's not that they're doing badly because they're rookies, but it's like they were dragged out of a public place against their will. I was looking forward to seeing the members for the first time in a long time, but I was embarrassed the whole time. I think from next time, only the members who want to appear should appear‚Äù and then a kgpd qrt then mentioning hanbin and then it just tunred into burner accounts going back and forth and dying off into personal insults. Tbh I‚Äôm still not sure what the issue actually was, no one on the I side said anything even the akgaes so I guess it‚Äôs died over there now. /+r/140869963996157005</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I've only seen clips and aside from myngj dick riding the extrovert members made it fun so I don't get it are they blaming gwk and tartar im assuming cuz their fans jumped in üò≠ I hate only seeing the aftermath cuz that's what I saw but yea probably an in the moment thing you'd have to understand. I saw one and only one alln akgae hop in and they were just calling zbwon shitty actors so I'm not sure</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>different anon but i think some of the members were tired (like hao for example) since the prerecording was at midnight and didn‚Äôt speak much. i watched the whole thing and i thought the daechinso lives with fewer zb1 members were more fun, it‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt know how to deal with the whole group so hanbin kept involving jaehyun and it felt like the live centered around him too much but idk there were still some funny moments /+r/140896534068941226</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-01-23 20:26:46</small></header><p>Ahhhhh I only saw tl bits cuz idk where to watch the full thing but I was assuming half the group was quiet it makes sense. So I guess the fight manifested from something else cuz neither tr or gwk were making it awk but I really hated that it was so myngj centered ughhh</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
