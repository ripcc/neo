But then today at her funeral he did another interview calling out wony begging her to come to his daughters funeral lowk gaslighting/ guilt tripping her omfg im so pissed like i get it his daughter is a huge wonyoung fan but stilll... now fuckass knets are saying how heartless of her to not go to her own fan's funeral that got murdered bruh she sent a wreath already and now because of this new interview from the dad begging her to attend if she goes now knets gonna say she just went to save her reputation.... omfg and then what happens later? if another fan passes away does she have to go to their funeral too? If she goes to this funeral but not another funeral then what?? are they gonna say shes picking favorites????? omfg she can't winnnn... the fucking dad is pissing me off because the funeral is no longer about his daughter who got murdered but about wonyoung, he made it about wonyoung and now everyone is talking about whether she gonna go or not.... and tbh maybe im overthinking but im so scared for wony... what if the dad holds a grudge against her for not going and does something... ppl are so fucked up u never know like im so fucking scared.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
