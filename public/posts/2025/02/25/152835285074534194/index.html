I can see yuehuaz being the most sucessful cause you got zh & yj the top3 members in sk and chn so the album sales might be secure. With rk having okay cfandom and he always attract ifans. While gv he can do things that he currently do. As for hb if he go solo and want to be successful he need to go for acting thats the unspoken rules. I'm not really glazing over ravi he will be discharge mybe after zb1 disbandment and if anything he must be depress as hell cause he need to enlist twice so I dont think he's in his right mind to work on music. If hb will be in a group which is a big possibility cause that p7 guy actually already have a company, they need really good music or concept but after all its probably not it cause they are non big4. I can see mt doesnt know what will he do yet. And gwðŸ˜­ i dont know sis fuck jellyfish I don't see jellyfish have a plan for dayeon so I can see the same thing happen to gw</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
