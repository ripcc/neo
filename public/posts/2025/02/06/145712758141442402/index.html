Exclusive as in like he has his own terms and conditions where yh cant control him as much and he has more say in what he wants to do. Because that's the only reason I can come up with on why duhua hates him so much or at least she didn't even push/ shout him out at all especially during bp when she did it for the gyu and yuj. Also not buying hot searches for him but did for zh during running man china and some other shit i forgot. /+r/145697834119944767</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
