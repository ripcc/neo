current yes24 zerobase showcase winner list for this cb: https://files.catbox.moe/waefng.jpeg a fansign winner list: https://files.catbox.moe/xeqbd5.png the name she gave on kepler blacklist is only half her name, the full one is on the showcase winner list, and you can see her phone number which matches the mcd blacklist on the fansign list. her tiktok account also displays her birth year that's the same on the blacklist. i heard she still sneaks into mcd in disguise to get past the staff even after the blacklist lmao /+r/147006351065960960</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I got a few things to add about the Twitter chick zb1leader. She is so weird, I got moots telling me she gets into fansigns, mcd recording, any pre recording etc via illegal ways. She used to "host" group orders on Twitter for joiners to buy so she can use the sales to get into fansigns etc. Apparently a couple of her joiners never got their stuff and she would claim on Twitter how she's on hiatus. Meanwhile on her TikTok and other sns accounts, you see her attending a bunch of zb1 concerts from south kroea to Japan to other Asia countries. She's also friends with the other Twitter account mycathao who recently complained about how foreigners not getting into the showcase. Either way that zb1leader is a weirdo. She's always saying how hanbin recognizes her and how other members also know she's hanbins fan. /+r/147009090000999136</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
