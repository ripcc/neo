Even with the way duhua talked about zb1 including not her own members makes it clear the company knows the value of having a hand in that group and to be completely honest zb1 is more successful with 4 yhz in it that any group yh has ever produced and they themselves know post disbandment no one is guaranteed success. Like anon said it’s a way more stable form of income to keep them in the group even if they negotiate for more management rights ect. There is a members whose company I think definitely won’t resign and that’s based on what I’ve heard here about their actions but each can make their own judgement on who that is because maybe I’m perceiving that differently too. Overall I think the group could continue with less members like the article said but if definitely won’t be with half the yhz gone and it would be fully dependent on who those members are. /+r/152834309139683065</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Successful or not it doesnt matter. If they succeed then its good but if they dont as usual there are other ways to gain money like sending hao and ricky to china and turn gyuvin and yujin into actors (not sure about yj cause he's still young) /+r/153328816507542604</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
