I think he’s just and kind and genuine irl and not a bad person, but he’s def not perfect and super polite and patient all the time as he is on camera. I actually thought it was sweet that Hao said that because it means Hanbin is comfortable with him. Like on camera or to most people he’s “perfect” all the time, but to people like hao and ig to some extent gyuvin and maybe matthew he lets down is guard and isn’t always as perfect and smiley and can show his annoyance or grievances which i thought was sweet LOL</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
