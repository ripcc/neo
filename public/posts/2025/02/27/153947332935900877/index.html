Sheâ€™s his manager ðŸ˜­ is that not her job ? And this whole fandom is well aware atp that all the members managements are somewhat involved. And not just for hb but for mt too I hate when they bring up cube like itâ€™s supposed to mean something, like both of them left â€¦ they literally have nothing to do with cube. If anything youâ€™d assume they hold more resentment to those two for investing that training in them for them to end up leaving. /+r/153577720390046523</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
