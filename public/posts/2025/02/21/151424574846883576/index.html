Step back and devil game are also so good and kinda funky, someone said devil game reminds them of exo lucky one and I can kinda see it, blue was nice but canâ€™t really tell since itâ€™s the same snippetâ€¦.ngl I donâ€™t think I really understand cruel, like it feels like itâ€™s a bit rock but also probably the most experimental out of all the tracks so feel like Iâ€™d have to listen to the full song to get it. Whatâ€™s ur ranking right now?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Blue has grown on me but I can't shake the feeling of it not being a strong enough title but we move.. cruel is pop rock like I expected but someone already mentioned none of the songs hit the 3 minute mark except for blue soooo idk how these r gonna sound ðŸ˜… And I'd rank it like this probably Devils game Step back Out of love Blue DrDr Cruel</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
