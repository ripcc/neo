I wouldnâ€™t like to get Taeraeâ€™s affection either. It always seems super performative and he basically begs to be treated special. I do not fuck with his personality. Itâ€™s particular in a weird way, sometimes heâ€™s attention seeking and itâ€™s off putting, etc. I like literally all the other members (except jiwoong, heâ€™s genuinely cringy). I know some fans will call me homophobic but it ainâ€™t that. Heâ€™s has a very weird personality that I donâ€™t trust. I fuck with the other gays in the group, Hao and Hanbin, even if Hanbinâ€™s personality is 99.9% cookie cutter safe.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
