I’m still a firm believer that they would have had him mc iland even if his management hadn’t ran the global auditions because he’s already an mc for another mnet show, they know he’s competent and it saved them a lot of time and probably money than having to go look externally to hire an mc. I never understood the bad rep when people act like his management is pushing him to get jobs, like they are his management I’d sure hope they are working hard to get opportunities for him. And why are we acting like his is the only management involved, this whole fandom is well aware yuehua is involved in securing a lot of stuff for Hariboz in China and managing their work there. Why is it bad if Hanbin’s management is doing the same for him 😭 like I don’t understand they don’t work for zb1 they work for him so how are you going to be mad that they are putting in the work for their own artist. And just to say it finally if this one manager alone was enough to create all this push then your issue isn’t the manager it’s yuehua because their director is an ex cj exec, they collaborated with wakeone for tour merch, their managers work with zb1 like if they still ain’t making moves to get shit done for their own artist that’s their problem 😭 (saying yuehua because whenever his management comes up there’s only 1 section of the fandom that has something to say about it) /+r/145590484809767557</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

There is clearer and more damning relations between yhz and wkn than there are with the other companies but it's always ignored and yea he was getting that mc job no matter what why would they outsource when they have their own mc from a survival show on emca. While it's not absurd that his management could help him get jobs but why would they get first pick over the other companies they're the newest and one of the smallest. I just think people want something extra to blame other than the fact that wkn chooses to give him his gigs and the push isn't coming from an outside source</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>yh should be involved in hariboz's gigs in china cause do you think wk1 can do it when they can't use weibo and xhs don't even mention their staff that no one speaks mandarin my problem with cjs was if they can use their resources for one member why not use it for other members too 😕 /+r/145604155426428458</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-02-05 20:56:21</small></header><p>they have staff and managers from yh it's not solely Chinese gigs that they're involved in but at this point of zbwon what do you mean? like is there a tunnel vision going on... resources get spent on the most useless member of the group all the time theres always different situations of multiple members getting accused of being favored but now its only one 😭?? its rlly not that stark the issue now is that there isn't a priority on group schedules not this omggggg yall love rehashing dumb stuff and as much as most wouldn't like to admit the distribution for solo gigs is better than most groups</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
