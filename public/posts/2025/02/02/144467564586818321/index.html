Apparently itâ€™s not about the lack of male trainees, like yes there is a decline but if 3 males survival shows running at the same time and all gather hundreds of trainees thereâ€™s no way bp2 wouldnâ€™t especially with seeing the success of zb1.
But like anon said they apparently are being super strict with who they take in which is why they donâ€™t have enough trainees yet tho I feel like they will take a lot from the survivals shows who just finished and made it to the finals but not debut /+r/144294457452485124</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
