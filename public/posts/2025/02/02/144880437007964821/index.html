And that's exactly who yechan was flexing wow.. I rmbr his sister too I feel like she's faking a lot of her content she does have rich friends (Julia ma and them) but idk 3 milly runs out eventually and yechan was gagging over chrome hearts jewelry so it's obvious the wealth is very very new if it's still there lolll and I mean if they scammed once who knows how many times they've done it. And Anna was just rude af she used to ague with people and say a lot of insensitive shit</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
