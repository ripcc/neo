It made me wonder since they definitely don’t seem as close as before, what happened? Were they close because of convenience or something? I just never hear about them hanging out or doing anything together anymore… then again I’ve noticed hao only ever really goes out with 2binz and yujin sometimes</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Also I feel like when there werent clear friendships in the group yet it was easy for them to be closer but they don't live in the same apartment even so I get it but about the photos that's probably cuz of haos broken phone with lost pics</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script></body></html>
