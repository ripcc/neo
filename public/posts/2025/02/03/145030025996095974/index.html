The concept feels like they're going back to their roots and it's apparently a direct continuation of cinpa I've seen theories of some musical/theatre concept which would make sense and include the action star bit like waitttt it could be cohesive if it ends being that</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>The aesthetic reminds me of a movie that I will not name about a man who is searching for his wife who went missing on a trip in a fictional sea country (he actually killed her and is lying to the police) but it's very romantic and cinematic with beach, tropical forest, and resort imagery and since they shot the mv in thailand, I think it will have a similar aesthetic - cinematic and focused on finding the love interest and adventuring through the landscape, the movie itself relies on some heavy exoticism of sea though /+r/144881413026699005</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
