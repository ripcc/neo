I do have to laugh tho because why did they have 100 people in that gc and think it was never going to be blasted 😭. These people will jump on jh/bnd just as quick if any of them say anything about hb but they haven’t till this point which is probably why they don’t bother although I don’t think it will stay that way after this so who knows maybe they will start fighting onedoors soon too.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
