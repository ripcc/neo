Not because of the new jeans drama but because their survival show was genuinely some of the most rigged shit ever and like almost none of them have aura or charisma and they seem awkward. I donâ€™t remember which member exactly but one of them has the worst vocal tone Iâ€™ve heard in years. And their songs arenâ€™t exceptionally good. Sometimes you can ignore rigged shows if the group is good (aka Fromis_9, super rigged show that got revealed via the court system but they had great songs and good vocals and charismatic members so no one gaf). But illit arenâ€™t like that ðŸ˜… I saw a video of them at some even and it was sooooo off</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
