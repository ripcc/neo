I'm just tired of these shippers acting like wonyoung is begging for him especially tiktokers when she isn't because they want her validation so bad yet responsible for so much of her hate.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

To add she not only said wolf but further specified a 'blunt' wolf and then Dex didn't understand what she meant by blunt and he said 'blunt? not as sharp?' (dumb translators thought she said that but it was Dex) and then she clarified no, blunt as in the ears aren't always pointing up. Another Korean thing and this is about personality, wolves are always alert/ tense/ uptight with their ears always up and alert listening to their environment in case they get ambushed but puppies have floppy ears because they're more carefree, fun and easygoing and that's what she meant by 'blunt wolf', wolf appearance but behind close doors, behind the intimidating face has a puppy like personality so basically she saying she likes gap moe and I'm sorry but there aint nothing gap moe about Sunghoon 🤦🏾‍♀️</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
