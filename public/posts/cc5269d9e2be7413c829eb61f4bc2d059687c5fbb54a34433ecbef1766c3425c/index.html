I'm pretty sure to get a green card as a Chinese immigrant there's only two ways you either have to invest into America or apply for a work visa (student visas also and family reunification) I think they most likely invested it's the faster process so I'm assuming they're planning for a long life there his sister would def pursue uni here too</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
