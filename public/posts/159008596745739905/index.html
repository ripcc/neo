Personally I think she's just an obsessive troll who is mostly all talk on the internet I doubt she has the guts to hate on hao to his face but I get why people are mad that she applied to his special stage if she has that history of hating him and was dumb enough to get caught doing it again</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I guess c fans know her but if sheâ€™s attending k events im guessing she doesnâ€™t actually do anything aside from being all talk on the internet because no oneâ€™s jumped her yet. Speaking of being all talk it reminded me of when she said something about stealing zh juice (from his room service probably) and another ssng who was at the hotel said I saw you and that didnâ€™t happen ðŸ˜­</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
