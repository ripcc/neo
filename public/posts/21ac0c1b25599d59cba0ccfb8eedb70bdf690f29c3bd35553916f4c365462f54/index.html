Gyuvin : What? Oh don't tell me, is Ricky singing too loud in the shower again?ðŸ˜­
Matthew: wordlessly points towards the Hybe leak Everyone gathers and reads silently, they are speechless when they see explicit details about their personal lives in the document
Matthew: tears welling up how could they know all this unless...
Hao: Someone betrayed us!
Hanbin: gulps b-but hyung how do they know about that time in the car I thought we were alone
Gyuvin : that time you guys started dancing really hard in the car, making it shake a lot?
Gunwook : gasps Gyubinie! That's not it
Hao: That can't be... I've only told this to one person...Soobin is my best friend, he wouldn't do this to me!
Yujin: gently pats Haos back but Hyung...it can only be him
Hao: maybe...b-but what about &amp;team?! Isn't Matthew friends with them?
Matthew: No way! they have things on me I've never shared to anyone
Ricky: reading the part on Matthew So it really was you who stole my strawberry milkshake!
Matthew " gulps well I better get going... Gunwook : Guys let's not fight...let's think about this logically, it could also be myung jaehyun!
Hanbin : gasps B-b-but he's my friend, he wouldn't do something like this!
Gunwook : shakes Hanbins shoulders Hyung! Get over yourself! It can only be him
Hanbin : wiping off his tears you're right..let's get done with this once and for all
Taerae: Ok so, Hanbin, distract him! Gunwook, you'll handle him! Hao, you'll interrogate him! Jiwoong...uh you just be Jiwoong! It's time to KILL THE ROMEO
