I rllllly hope that doesn't happen but all I can think of is kpop sightings getting dragged and the videos of the fans at the airport past immigration and stuff and the other invasive videos or the info that gets posted just constantly being cross posted and used as rage bait to spark Twitter discourse and it might even make cfans stop posting on there if people start commenting and stuff</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
