<small>2025-03-19 00:50:45</small></header><p>DECEMBER 2024 😭??? Oh sis I gotta hear your story about why you decided to stan and somehow got here I'm crying... December 2024... uhmmmmm yknow what yea it used to be better than this but not by a lot unfortunately 😭. Most we've ever got was from 2023 to around mid 2024 but it was somewhat excusable because of the tour, but now they're just being extremely lazy and unemployed for whatever reason. Ur miskeen tho the beginning was a lotttt better than it is now the next group live might be... after they perform at the fancons it's bleak sorry 😭 I'm just astonished, but my biggest tip is to expect doom that's when shit usually turns around any sign of hope is a dead mission. Just realized this means youve only ever experienced PURELY zepisodes no zbtv or zb1folder........... I rmbr i said 2025 would probably be modeled exactly 2024 in a negative tone since 2024 was shit but.. ITS ACTUALLY WORSE OMG I WISH IT WAS 2024 AGAIN TURN BACK TIME!!!!!!!!!</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160537161983286588 class=replyLink>/+r/160537161983286588</a>i joined in feb..... this year 🧍🏾 LMFAOOOOOO my moots always shitting on u guys with gayb1 shit so the algorithm just gave me a bunch of zb1 clips and well zb1 are so funny 😭 i also liked doctor doctor a lot so im here now 🙋🏾‍♀️ heres a secret a lot of peeps who hate on u guys on x r closet fans</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
