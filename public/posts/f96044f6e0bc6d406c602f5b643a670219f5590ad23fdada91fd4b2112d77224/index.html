It’s really weird with Gunwook though because he can reach high notes smoothly if he focuses on it (and when he’s singing in range with his vibrato it’s so freaking good) but he rarely does it. He opts for more “shouting” it. Listen to his high note from the new street fighter song zb1 dropped and you’ll know what I mean. I wonder if it’s an issue of most zb1’s songs being too high, an issue of just normalized bad technique, or sort of laziness. 😅 I’m not super super knowledgeable about singing so if you know more plz elaborate (or any anons) if it’s a technique thing or a tone thing</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I'm trying to guess here irdk but also her notes require length gunwooks was really small I'm ngl I didn't even notice it 😭😭 it's just too high for him its going to sound difficult no matter what I'm not that knowledgeable either but I don't think it's a technique thing</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
