And she doesn't hate Hao, she was calling him cute and was reposting his posts. She makes a lot of troll posts though. Not only about hao but about Hanbin too. Her bias is still Hanbin and she is also a haobin shipper. But she should be careful about what she posts because from what I saw she obviously likes hao but a little crazy about it. Maybe a love hate feeling. But one thing good about her is that she also goes to their fansigns but I haven't seen any invasive ship questions or repos from her. She however reposts and talks about other ship repos. She is just a little crazy.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

She obviously doesn't care about being careful she operates like a troll I just think people shouldn't take her serious or watch what she does it doesn't matter nothings stopping her ðŸ˜­</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160473934914081319 class=replyLink>/+r/160473934914081319</a>If anyone finds her new account, then it is easy to find her twitter account too. She should be careful after losing her old weibo account but it seems like she doesn't want to be careful because she posted about getting cancelled and all her friends follow her already. And didn't noir know about her too or am I wrong? But they are not mutuals in twitter.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
