I think that’s an interesting difference I’ve noticed (before anyone says anything please don’t think I’m saying any sf is good both allins and rosins are devils) but rosins if mad will stop streaming and vote the opposition ect in retaliation even if it goes against what their bias says while allins will still at least actively vote and stream and their whole basis is its what hanbin wants. I do find that difference in mindset interesting even though both sf are similar in many other aspects</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

It is depressing af if his group doesn't win anything and if I'm not mistaken hanbin did mention about wanting an emca win before they won for gsb so it did put a lot of pressure on his fans. Thats how I know they rent lot of melon passes cause they were really really desperate</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
