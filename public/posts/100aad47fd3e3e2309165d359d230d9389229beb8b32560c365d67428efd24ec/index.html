Gyuvin seems like the type to fall too deep knowing its was never gonna work out, goes through a short slump as to why it didn't work out then in his next relationship over does it to make sure it works out but it just stresses his partner out and gets dumped again and repeat. I feel like matthew will date just so he feels at home like he doesn't need to be in love and yeah I agree if it doesn't work out he might take a break for years to find another perfect 'home'. Hao I feel like he'll date anyone that's korean LMFAOOO he doesn't give me long term but at the same time he also doesn't give one night stands, for him I'm confused.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
