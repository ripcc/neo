A bit north of Shanghai before going to Taiwan then to Korea and they left Taiwan before Taiwan became Taiwan if that makes sense so her family is technically still Chinese and not Taiwanese but her kfans say Taiwanese cause it's better than being Chinese. Pan k gurlies always say her body proportion looks Northern Chinese small head long limbs like those douyin gurlies to say she's Chinese but the funny thing is they say that to insult her but hey I'll take that compliment üòÇ‚úåÔ∏è</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
