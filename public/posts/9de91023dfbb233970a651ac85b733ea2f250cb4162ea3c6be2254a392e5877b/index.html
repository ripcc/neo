Not just weight gain - he for sure had something done. I don‚Äôt like him because his vibes are ick, not in like a creepy way but in an overly emotional, dramatic and bitchy way. Chenle also gives judgy. Yk fuck it fuck like all of nct. Johnny can‚Äôt sing or rap, Yuta‚Äôs filler makes ricky looks natural. Mark serves absolute nerdy sleazy vibes (his is forgivable but just a bit cringe). Jaemin has sinister energy but at least his body is insane. Jeno for sure has several hoes even if he has half of a personality. Jaehyun said a slur but everyone already knows that. Haechann seems gross. Hendery too underrated but I ain‚Äôt forget him and Kun wearing those fuckass dreads. Ten gives outdated millennial who doesn‚Äôt think deep enough. Sion too busy playing with his dick during livestreams to be professional. Doyoung‚Ä¶.. Taeyong‚Ä¶. Eh I give up fuck Lucas and death to taeil. And xiaojun you‚Äôre cool or whateve plus shout-out to your dad for being a drag queen. Idc ‚Äòbout the rest but like sakuya you chill and get a pass for being Yujin‚Äôs age. Sungchan and shotaro‚Ä¶. thin fucking ice. FAWK eunseok. Glory to Lee soo man.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
