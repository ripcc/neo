Just want to clarify I donâ€™t ship haobin, not bias hanbin or hao but as a large part of the fandom individually and as a duo itâ€™s hard to miss what goes on with them. I 100% agree shippers get more comfortable asking hao stuff because they speak the same language but Iâ€™m sorry I can completely coddle this grown man. Half the reason why the questions have gotten as invasive as they have is because he does feed into them and he does give them answers they want and yes sometimes they fish for answers but Iâ€™ve seen equally as many repos where he could have given normal answers and chose not too. Thereâ€™s also the argument that shippers will scold them, Iâ€™m sorry to tell you but both these men are going to get scolded anyway, for handing out with other men for not posting with eachother ect. Like at a certain point we have to acknowledge it takes two to tango and it didnâ€™t get this bad on its own. *************** Yes I think the shippers should learn some boundaries and respect too but haoâ€™s 24 and extremely smart he knows what heâ€™s doing too.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I feel like everyone on here knows that but it's still weird for zerocolas to dig for stuff or cross boundaries since he'll tell them what they want to hear even without the leading questions. Like asking him what he would do if his phone gallery got hacked is crazy work that's when I feel for the dude. Two things can be true at once, he's good at feeding shippers and the questions are getting weirder</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
