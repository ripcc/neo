Idk what this is all about but that does suck I've already got mention ab yh in my inbox but I woke up randomly and I'm bouncing so I'm not getting into that rn</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138960892950961624 class=replyLink>/+r/138960892950961624</a>Iâ€™m not sure what the yuehua asks are about but in regard to dispatch the only posted 8 members pics on Weibo but not Ricky which suprised me because the kr dispatch team seem to love Ricky like they always interact with him at the airport and make him the thumbnail so this did surprise me from their Weibo admin</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And like you said this wouldn't happen on the Korean side so imo it's completely on dispatch weibo not anything else</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
