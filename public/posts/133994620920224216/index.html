Her friends are coming out and saying her condition is because of her company, which is one of the top ones in China. They allegedly would beat her up, verbally abuse her, and physically abuse her when she didn’t win the top contracts for movies or shows. One her specific conditions (idk the exact name) is caused from head trauma and that’s why she can’t talk. She might die and she has asked her friends and family to save her before. It’s really bad. I believe she’s in the hospital right now but it’s so fucking depressing</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
