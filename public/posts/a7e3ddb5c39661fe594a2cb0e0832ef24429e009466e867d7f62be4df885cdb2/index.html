Anyone in their right mind would want to keep Zb1 who sells millions of albums and can fill arenas. It would be more surprising if they don't try considering that they tried it to Kepler which gave them not even 10% of zb1's revenue. The best that they can do is team up with Thelive or Yuehua. But with how the things are going, they're leaning to Thelive team up which will give us more hope for Hanbin, Matthew, Gunwook and Taerae redebut or continue as zb1 since they got the rights for the name. Yuehuaz will leave and redebut with a new name. Uncle in Yaoi before he goes to military. Although, it would definitely be hard business wise because the top 2 moneymakers are in Yuehua. Wk1's only hope is to build the name of whoever will continue before they disband to expand their fandoms. They still have over a year to do it.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
