This is just my assumptions he probably got his chin implant when he got into yuehua china? Dunno but the chin implant was horrendous and unnaturally pointy that in June-ish he prob got jaw fillers around the chin implant to make that area fuller, blend the obvious implant line so that the chin implant isn't so obvious now that there's volume on the side. And it's probably why his face looks extra weird when he's bloated because filler is hydrophilic.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
