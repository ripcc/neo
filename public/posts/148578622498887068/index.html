My bro got Lasik and he regrets it so bad cuz dry eyes is one if the side effects. Rk also prob so busy ain't getting no sleep plus always having to wear makeup so prob irritated him even more since japan. He said on pchat he went to the doctor yesterday so that's good and idk riyangis mad saying wk1 won't let him go to the doctor and shit.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
