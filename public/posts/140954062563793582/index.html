It will never take out a plane if it did we'd have 10 crashes everyday. I'm watching retired pilot youtubers talk about it right now and they were like maybe it's a cover up because it was pilot error and they don't want to admit it. Apparently the bird hit the right engine but during landing the right engine was still on and you can tell because it was emitting those foggy heat waves but the left engine had none of it meaning it was off so they're saying the pilots might've turned off the wrong engine.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And that makes sense I've only seen people criticizing the airline and most crashes these days are due to company's cutting corners I feel like that could be it alongside pilot issue. Cuz I'm sure if it was just the pilot they would've thrown blame</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140952290910754065 class=replyLink>/+r/140952290910754065</a>diff anon but the airport got shat on from every country for their stupid ass layout like who the fuck puts a cement wall at the end of the runway? if the plane kept sliding until it stopped on its own everyone probably wouldve survived</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
