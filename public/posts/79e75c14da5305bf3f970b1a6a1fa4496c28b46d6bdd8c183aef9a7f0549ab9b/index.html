From what we know I just think of his dad as that stereotypical kdrama CEO dad (idk if he's ceo but he's gotta be up around there) who's always away for business and comes home once every couple months while his wife and kids live comfortably in a mansion so naturally the mom is closer with the kids but doesn't mean the dad doesn't love them, he's just busy working so his family can live comfortably and that's his way of love even though it sacrifices bonding time since I'm pretty sure his business is in Vegas. So they're probably not as close as other father son but he probably loves them just like any other father. They just live in a different world and I don't think we can say what's love and what's not love 🤷🏾‍♀️</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
