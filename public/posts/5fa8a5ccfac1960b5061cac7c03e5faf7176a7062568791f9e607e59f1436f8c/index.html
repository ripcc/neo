Then the Koreaboo article got posted using hanbin’s pic even though op never revealed the fandom name so then op stated getting mass qrts from kallins even k zeroes saying they should just say the fandom name because now other innocent fandoms/idols names are getting dragged into it when they did nothing. K-zeroes are still mad at op because the video spread to other sites before they clarified it had nothing to do with hanbin /zerose/allins so people just went and blamed zeroes on a whole even though all the kfans knew it wasnt. Then op got a spin asking who it was, the confirmed it was tbz fans and they even apologised to the artist and fandom (hanbin and zerose) for getting them unnecessarily dragged into this when it could have been avoided had they just clarified earlier. Pretty sure they got mass jumped by tbz fans because not even an hour after they posted the clarification they took it all down.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
