I’m not talking about genuinely uncalled for situations, but the shit anyone with a brain would expect to be an issue. You think sleeping around and smoking is a good idea while you’re a trainee? Or going clubbing is smart? This isn’t even just about Seunghan, like Yunjin and her corny songs about how hard idol life is, as if her members didn’t share their insane ED diets and workouts to fans who are at the likeliest age to develop an ED. I don’t ignore the fact most trainees started young but they signed up for one of the most vapid industries in the world where you hope to be worshiped and praised for doing a little dancey dance and rarely singing, while promoting brands who outright fund weapon manufacturers. You think idols foaming at the mouth for an iPhone sponsorship are mindful that iPhones are made from extremely exploitive material and cobalt from child mines in the Congo and that their promotion could directly increase consumption and makes circumstances even worse for exploited workers? They don’t give a fawk. So yeah, I think in return for being a millionaire (the successful groups) alongside being worshipped (even if it’s conditional) they deserve the hyper scrutiny because of the industry they decide to be in. Also, of course your looks are going to be everything, that’s what makes you worth being an “idol” for someone to strive towards and it’s also why average Joe who sings at the bar down the street will never be a superstar. This isn’t the local high school talent show. Also, everyone’s work is hard, not just their own. I work for a pretty prestigious industry and have had to sign numerous documents dictating my behavior including my personal life and if I cross that I get blacklisted. There are expectations for behavior even for fast food workers. At least with being an idol you have the potential to make way more money and have fans.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Like you can't expect to debut and not have a clean past it doesn't work like that I mean it's possible but you have to face the consequences but in the case of the morality trainees especially young ones rlly don't got a clue what real idol life is like nor do they have the power to decide whay they can do their entire image is manufactured so I can give grace for that. But exactlyyyyyyyyyyy you can't become an idol and not also have extraordinary character</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
