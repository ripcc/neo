That’s why Street Woman Fighter blew up; it was fresh, something different. Honestly, Mnet needs to make Ahn Joon Young one of their head producer and director again. I know he’s back with them, but it’s in a lower position. And say what you want about him, but the man knew exactly what he was doing. Broduce S2 was massive because of him the way he built up the hype for that season was insanse like Baekho’s whole storyline was peak, and then out of nowhere, he turned Kang Daniel into THE it boy. It was wild; you really had to be there to see it all happen. And yeah, the Planet series was good, but I’m not that into it anymore. Mnet should honestly have Ahn Joon Young create another idol show that’s different from the Produce format but can still bring that same hype and energy, if you know what I mean.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
