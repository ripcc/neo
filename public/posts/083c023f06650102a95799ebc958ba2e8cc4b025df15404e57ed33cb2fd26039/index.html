I don't rmb what they were saying exactly but something along the lines of him being selfish dancing and practicing by himself for aju nice ruining the group atmosphere pissed them off because it made Chinese ppl look bad because everyone, k and jnetz especially were bashing him and cnets really liked Hiroto I mean he aint their one pick but they have a soft spot for him from Chuang. And from what I'm understanding rn its he took someone's lines? Idk I'm not watching p7 but that's what started this recent weibo hate train</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
