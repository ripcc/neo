but yea anyways honda makes good cars, i would also rec. the toyota rav4 because it's fairly similar and is also reliable! but tbh all newer cars are built worse than they used to be :/ everythings just built bad nowadays so make sure to try your hardest in maintenance so you can make it last a while</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
