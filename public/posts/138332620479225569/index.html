I even saw people in dc being more angry about wk1 not replying than about Hanbin losing the china personal schedule. They are like if the schedules don't match, at least reply that he can't do it. From what they were talking about I think it is a pictorial. Some of them are even going "compensate with a korean pictorial at least".... These girls don't really care about the offer but more about how the company is incompetent, and hanbin(or any member) could've lost more because of them not replying.... Also, I remember something like this happened with hao bar too</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
