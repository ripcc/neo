But agree not his job and he's already the leader so he has a lot on his plate anyone who blames him for shit like this isn't smart and basically dunking on the other members capabilities to perform anyways</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
