YouTube was zhang hao only for a good two hours until allins saw the zhg post and copied it. I was so mad because people were cursing the fuck out of zhang hao in the comments for "chinese commenting team" and "don't ever pick this guy because his fandom is crazy" and "xi jinping" bullshit when it was international fans commenting and then once all of the other zb1 fandoms got here they never attacked them even though hanbin's fans were also acting like bots they just hate chinese people. It was so bad that kfans were telling rosins to stop posting.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
