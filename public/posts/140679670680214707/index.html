I'm curious but also not if he's still in a relationship down the line people will figure it out soon enough</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140630215591417886 class=replyLink>/+r/140630215591417886</a>didnâ€™t he watch a lot of animes? my friend picked up japanese from animes too and while her vocab isnâ€™t wide she nailed down the pronunciation so that might be the case with gunwook too</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
