I think they wanted him back to give him a second chance out of the goodness of their hearts and friendship + SM wanting that extra skill set and global push but it backfired terribly. SM really should’ve had the foresight to prevent all this from happening and kicked him out for good but this just added an extra layer of pain and confusion for everybody seunghan, riize and the fans. It’s so sad seeing him walk out of the SM building and having to face those funeral flowers.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

But personal feelings aside I'm sure most of them didn't wanna risk anything either it's crazy how predictable the fans wrath was but sm didn't care at allllll like regardless of what he did he's gonna be traumatized for life and his time was wasted early 2024 was the perfect time to bring him back and they should've just let him go without even trying this time around people would've wished him well but now there's this mess</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
