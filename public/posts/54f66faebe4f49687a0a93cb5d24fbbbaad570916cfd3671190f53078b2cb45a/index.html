I can't see it or maybe I'm just coping cuz that's my wookie bear but yeah I think he'll flirt with others while in a relationship cuz he's just flirtatious bit nothing more. Ricky I feel like these are takes from ppl who don't know him yet but yeah agree with queef once u know more about him he's like the down bad commited foe life type, he barely let's anyone inside his circle. Gyuvin I think he'll cheat without knowing, not physically but like be overly flirty with someone while in a relationship cuz he doesn't know boundaries and that led that person on and that person thinks they're dating but to gyuvin he was just friendly and then bam gf finds out and think hes cheating</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
