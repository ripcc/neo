For Ricky tho omg they haveee to push him this Japanese comeback, specifically in Japanese varieties but also just push him as a visual over Yujin in Japan, the amount of interactions he gets literally not doing anything (for example this tweet just describing him getting 17k) it would be such a waste not to use him rn, obviously what's tricky with Ricky is that he also just does what he wants but he's also someone I would make go live more often especially with gyuvin and Matthew because he's great at bouncing off others and would get viral moments, he's also gotten better at singing so he can be pushed a little more there too</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
