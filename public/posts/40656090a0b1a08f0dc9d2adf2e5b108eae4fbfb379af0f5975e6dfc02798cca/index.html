Though I still think that Ricky looks the best even as a rosin. Hao gagged me like I remember so many repos saying that the first thing you'll see about Hao are his features before his face and it's true lmao. Like I saw his nose, then lips and eyes, then the whole face altogether as it's very eyecatching ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Ricky's face though. Ooh don't end those who think you don't look good cause he fucking is. Gunwook is like verrryyyyyy ATTRACTIVE in a sense that he knows he's hot and he's acting all cute and hot and he's so attractive and he's so handsome you get what I'm saying???? Yujin is really their visual with his prince features. Like it's really both Ricky and yujin but Ricky just looks more attractive lol Visual ranking after watching them live: Ricky Yujin Hao Gunwook Hanbin (very cute, he really suits fresh image on him lol) Gyuvin (very very puppy like lol especially when he smiles) Uncle (he was 5 or above hanbin during soundcheck but went down to seven when they are on the main concert) Matthew (HOT!!!!)
