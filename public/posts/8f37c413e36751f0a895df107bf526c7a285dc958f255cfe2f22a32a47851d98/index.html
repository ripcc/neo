I'm lowkey sussing an eyelid surgery pre boys planet tbh but I also noticed his eyes look different from boys planet to now but I'm not sure because he could be like Ricky and just wears eyelid tape yupyup also to add, I think a lot of anon thinks Gyuvin had a nose job but on a bubble live he was purposely bending it side to side to debunk nose job rumors and I agree, I don't think he got nose job/ implant but he definitely did something to his nose like nose bridge and tip filler hence why he can bend it like that. honestly I miss those days, it was so funny seeing anons reaction to debunks cause I remember specifically this one anon going on a whole redemption arc for calling Ricky botched and how they felt so guilty ðŸ˜­</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
