Her dad is third gen hwagyo? (chinese living in Korea) and his entire restaurant brand is based off being third generation Chinese. Like anon said every Korean Wonyoung fans knows this but what is uncertain is her mom, there's rumors that Wonyoung uncle on her mom side, so her mom's brother is the president or something for some Chinese embassy like group and is fighting for Chinese rights to vote in Korea hinting that her mom side has Chinese blood too. Also after stanning ZB1 and having first hand experience, international fans are just as sinophobic as knets, the difference is knets are open about it but international fans aren't even aware that the stuff they say are extremely sinophobic.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
