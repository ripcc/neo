And yea damn they're def connected the anon who was in korea for sometime said that a lot of the intl zeroses there are kinda weird so I wouldn't be surprised if it was smth like that all cliqued up all cracked up. but I meannnnnnn it has to be I went through her EXTENSIVE thread of interactions and overall moments with her biases she Stan's a lot of groups and does sooo many fancalls and fansigns for all of them and travels to korea frequently it probably is some kind of drug because her life certainly revolves around it interesting tho</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
