They're probably getting this info from people questioning the sales poster ricky's cbar posted? Taobao sales are very transparent and update in real time, ricky's cbar posted saying he'd sold 3795 gift boxes when at the time it only said 2000+ sold on taobao which means anywhere from 2000-2999 so they're probably using that data to fight on the cside lmaooo in the same vein I saw cmulbokdans straight up go and question uniskin customer service about the sales too you know crosins and cmuls wouldn't let something like this go. I'm not sure if his cbar was counting sales from outside of taobao which led to this difference in numbers but yeah they should be more careful when posting this stuff</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
