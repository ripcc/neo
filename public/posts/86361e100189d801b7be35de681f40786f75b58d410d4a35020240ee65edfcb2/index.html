Like i get it, quite a few of these chinese trainees are a bit older and would have a better chance in china than be on this survival korean/chinese idol group made on a show that barely made any noise and they will probably be bound on a 3 year contract with iqiyi with korean management which is why they want to back out + all the injuries they have as well. I feel like they went on the show believing it was a chinese survival show with a international spin but it really turned out to be a korean survival</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
