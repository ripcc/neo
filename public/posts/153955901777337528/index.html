Bust out music whenever they wanna, post on ig every now and then, go mia for 2 months then suddenly drop new music/ cover/ photoshoot and repeat and random tiktok/ ig lives in between. I just find it funny his fans preach about loving him for who he is and how he's different but in the same breath be comparing him to other members with all these graphs because he isnt going on pchat every fucking day and can't accept that he's different so they start blaming anything and everything. Please he is not pchat banned... and when u say that to them they're like 'oh yeah? rmb when u guys were crashing out when the group got banned for a week? we had to deal with this ban since nov 2023 so don't talk' and I'm like umm yeah because a plane full of ppl died and the other ban was cause the fucking president was getting impeach you dumb fucks, so you're saying whatever ricky did to get 'banned' since nov 2023 was worst then those two combined???????? Him not being socially active isn't even a bad thing but they made it into a bad thing because they were comparing him to the members after preaching about loving him for being different and not like other idols. I love ricky too but like his fans pmo so much that the only way I can enjoy him is just not engage with them at all and i only follow some of his k fan accounts.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
