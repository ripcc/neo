I'm actually so nosy and have talked to so many batshit insane k and c fan atp that I can precisely point out the source for most gossipsü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èand yes a lott are trustworthy and real
But honestly they're more gossipy simply because zcs and kbnb stalkerish fans are the goats of sharing, I've tried to hit up sooo many solo saesaengs and they're all too batshit insane and unlikeable and usually low-key hate their favs and so it pisses them off when you ask for shit annddd they always want to receive infos with no return ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è meanwhile the Korean nb fans I've chatted with even the super creepy ones that everyone hate you can still converse with like normal people and they would take the bare minimum exclusive haobin info even if they know way better things and will give me crazy things in return like who the members are dating when it started who's whos ex who's doing that because they don't really care about the other members that much anyways went off on a tangent my bad but fe shout out to the two insane Korean nb fans Ive chatted with I've got some finstas and gf names from them try your luck with one if you have like an unseen sighting or smthg they're nosy af and are the goats of sharing</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

But damn are you just dming Twitter users I might have to try doing this one day but are u willing to share finstas with just me üëÄ?</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138859317066684445 class=replyLink>/+r/138859317066684445</a>Yeah I'm not well weeded in the cside yet I need to get to it but I just started dming Korean accounts asking them oh hey I know you know a lot about x is this rumour true as a conversation starter and a lot of them are down to exchange kkts to converse further you have to pretend to be Korean tho also some of the more batshit ones don't gossip they're like pay me to speak although that's a bit more rare, kbnb fans are what I advise because the basis of exchanging tea for them is fangirling while for other fans they're going to be more defensive because potential gfs smoking etc aren't things they like and so they're bitter but there's still very nice solos and in the k-side specifically all the intense fans know all of the closest staffs to zb1 so pretty different than cside rumours that usually are from saesaengs or friends or family in the hariboz case although there is a few members with snake friends lol I had Taerae, Hanbin, Matthew and Haos finstas but everyone else but Matthew deactivated or stopped using it I'll ask for new ones when I'm free tho I haven't been in people's business in a while I had yujins one too they all had like 11-14 followers and followed like 20 people you already know Taerae and Matthews username haos was like directly referencing his name and yujin and hanbin had the keyboard smashes ones and I've heard hanbin has or had several</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And yup the kside get stuff through actual connections I've heard about people knowing staff through friends it's interesting but way more locked down I feel like. And yasss hit me up I've been trying to find gwks but his would probably be the hardest ugh</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
