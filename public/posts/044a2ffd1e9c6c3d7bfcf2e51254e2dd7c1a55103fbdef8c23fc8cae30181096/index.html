Like, okay, min hee Jin is weird, but everyone now saying she’s a prostitute for saying in her texts that she might sleep with someone if it makes the HYBE/New Jeans conflict easier cannot have a complex thought to save their lives. 1. Even if she was a prostitute, why are you shaming her and not the men? 2. If she’s willing to sell her body to help New Jeans, then doesn’t that speak to how much she’s willing to do for them? Like, she’s already selling her house to help with the fees. She’s literally throwing her life away if this doesn’t work out. That’s desperation, not just for herself but for those girls, and I think it should be somewhat admired rather than people slutshaming her. I would only ever do that if it was a life or death situation for my family. Maybe actually think for a second how intense things are for her to go that far? 3. She was gross for having an affair with that married guy but once again, that doesn’t involve new jeans and the dude wasn’t in HYBE, therefore it was just her messy business so it’s irrelevant unless someone is trying to confirm their bias. Also she isn’t a fucking idol, she’s a director who chose to go super public to protect her craft and new jeans. Now HYBE/BTS Stan’s are looking at any photos new jeans took with men and inferring that they are prostitutes and that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree… not to speak ill but maybe yeontan V’s dog passing away was karmaaaa</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
