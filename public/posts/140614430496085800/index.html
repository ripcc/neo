Information for their second fanclub was released a month ago, but in the fine print it said that the artist's schedules were subject to be interrupted before the fanclub period ended ? Or something along those lines saying that so it feels like a total scam to me knowing Jelpi refuses to give fans info on their actual contract length.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>hachi</strong>
