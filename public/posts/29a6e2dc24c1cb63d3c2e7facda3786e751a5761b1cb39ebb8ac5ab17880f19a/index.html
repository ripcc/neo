So did wakeone unban him for 5 mins and put him back on the ban because he never came after that? Dumbass riyangis say wakeone only lets him come onto pchat to talk about brand stuff but what brand was he promoting at the airport 10 days ago? So why did wakeone let him talk about uniskin but not katokato on pchat? Like it's sooooooooooooo fucking stupid and makes zero sense. Bringing that stupid chinese chart onto twitter was a bad idea because anyone thats not a dumbass dense riyangi can tell he only comes when tehres something new or exciting to talk about... and that's fucking okay.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I think atp besides the obviously slow riyangis and general zeroses who jump on everything the people that are actually in to him dont talk about bans like that except for when the convos reignited its so dumb tho and theyre never getting it</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
