Idk what this is all about but that does suck I've already got mention ab yh in my inbox but I woke up randomly and I'm bouncing so I'm not getting into that rn</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138960892950961624 class=replyLink>/+r/138960892950961624</a>How is it not targeted if it's him most of the time? lmao and dispatch is owned by cj so it very much is targeted everyone knows riyangis can be dumb but saying it's not targeted is a crazy ass statement, sinophobia is a rampant issue in kpop companies and it's getting worse just take a look at other popular groups who have chinese members they have almost the same problems if you don't care that's fine but stop watering down issues just because it doesn't affect you or your bias tf</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-01-18 13:09:48</small></header><p>What is him most of the time? Is he consistently being left out on dispatch weibo posts or smth and ofc Sinophobia is rampant in kpop the biggest thing is the lack of exposure to Korean media and that's not even the topic of conversation rn. Cj owning dispatch doesn't mean there's a direct link even if there was an agenda against Ricky the big company on top isn't making boss calls to dispatch weibo to leave him out. I can't speak for other current groups but I used to ult winwin the problems weren't even near the same and why look at other groups when we have another chinese member in the group ðŸ˜­ and yall say this like I wouldn't get jumped if I said I didn't care I lose with yall either way but idrc ab that I like Ricky so I'll have discussion if i feel like it I guess we're all just gonna be mad then</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
