I think itâ€™s just called kpop but it seems very thorough on industry workings rather than the training a kpop idol does. He said on his lmj he was actually accepted into two other universities but for different majors I imagine he went with this because the curriculum covered a lot more things that would benefit him.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
