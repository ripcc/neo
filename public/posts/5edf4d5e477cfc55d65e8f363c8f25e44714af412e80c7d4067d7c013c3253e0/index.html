This industry is so oversaturated and there is constantly new groups out trying to gain the spotlight and him being a foreign idol where oppotunities are already so limited. Glad he is being so open with us though but these survival shows canâ€™t hold a candle to boys planet tbh and the influx is due to how huge boys planet was hao please chill ðŸ˜­ but it could be other insecurities as well</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

The average group wouldn't have to worry about something like this and with just short of 1.5 years it's not a whole lot they can do to cement themselves I feel bad BUT RIHHT CJDJJDMDKDK THESE NEW SURVIVAL SHOWS ARE SHITTTTTTT everyone's saying we should've appreciated how pretty bp trainees were and how good zb1 is the new shows are so ass and the trainees are worse I think zb1s gonna be remembered for a long time they revived the boy group market for a bit no matter how sabotaged they were they made their mark ayeee</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
