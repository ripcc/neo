<small>2025-01-10 22:02:04</small></header><p>idk how you were into that in the first place it's the stalest shit ever BUT SIS IDK MATTWOOK HAVE MOMENTS FOR DAYSSSSSS you just have to like Matthew and the dynamic like they're so close and bring each other up so often it's hard not to like. I love everything about them like wow I was talking about them today with my friends and almost died LIKE WOW THESE ARE THE FUCKING GOATS PLEASE STAY TOGETHER FOREVER 😭😭😭🩷🩷🩷🩷 Idk what it's like to like the duo from a seokryu point of view but as a gpd Matthew was literally the first person to really extend his hand to gwk when the group formed and took care of him and for that he'll always have a special place in my heart so I just love the dynamic cuz it's so genuine the ship side is even more tea cuz it's freaky yasssssss wow u got me too lit bro come to the good side it's time you eat real food</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/136543390975349928 class=replyLink>/+r/136543390975349928</a>idk if it’s just me but i cannot get into popular duos for the life of me like i used to be a gyubriker then the ship blew up and i muted their names because it just got annoying as fuuuck but i think it was just because of the ones who think ricky’s a girl lmfaoaoao I’m getting there with mattparkz though pls root for meeee sista😭😭😭😭😭 and sorry i know this’ll piss u off but being a taegunv shipper is such a fun experience sometimes like u lowkey have no choice but to treat crumbs like four-course meals and the korean geontaelers thrive even in the deepest pits of poverty like those girls get LITTTT over them standing next to eo in the airport</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-01-13 22:01:51</small></header><p>im kinda like that but i dont deny myself tea. and also the fans being annoying and stupid stopping your enjoyment is reasonable like even i dropped mattwook for a bit cuz of the way people painted gwk but its all good now good luck 💁‍♀️. and i mean irdc it was just never for me i will say i was always jelly of the fanart cuz thats my favorite thing but these people just wanna keep begging mid THEY CAN HAVE IT!!!! i could always tell the lack of everything was a bit of a charm point thats kinda how i moved with rkgw in 2023 but im not built for the losing team like that</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
