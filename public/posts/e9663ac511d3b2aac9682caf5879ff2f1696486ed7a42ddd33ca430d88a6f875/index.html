I also think they steal his presents too cuz again, they've been multiple cases of ris spotting clothes they bought for ricky on other members for concept pics and such.... if it's true.... this is so vile. they're exploiting him and not even pay him back anything in returns</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
