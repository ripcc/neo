hao- mix of eye contact or straight up ignoring
hanbin- he has more of a resting cute face? Ik that's not has natural face but he holds that also ngl I don't watch his vids much
taerae- I've probably seen like 5 taerae vids max but you can really tell what he's thinking on his face matthew- ngl if someone was talking to him in english all up in his space he'd probably talk back ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ that's just the vibe I get but I don't see him do much from the federal vids I come across
Ricky- face on at all times regardless of which type of fan but he blatantly ignores ssngs
gyuvin- I've seen kssng? that was at the busan pick site with them and I'm not even kidding she took a picture of gyuvin less than a foot away from him and he was just looking at her his boundaries just seem a lot looser
gunwook- has a pretty intense stare ngl he's rlly good at giving interactions but it's usually towards fans the federal vids are just ignoring he's the type to reply if u say smth to him tho
Yujin- ignores everyone I'm trying to just base this off of the videos I see on xhs not everything I see is from sasaengs it's more invasive fans and it really depends on the day, how they feel, what the specific person says or does, if they're a regular or not, location, etc like it all depends. That's just my observation they definitely recognize their sasaengs and frequent fans and they'll treat them accordingly. anyone else can add what they've observed</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
