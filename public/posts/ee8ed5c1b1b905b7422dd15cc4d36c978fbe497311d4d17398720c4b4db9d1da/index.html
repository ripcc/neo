I can like try to mentally break it down so her flights are definitely the most expensive and if she's not staying over 1-2 weeks accommodation shouldn't be that expensive and the concert fees plus shopping hmmmmm she's probably spending somewhere around $2k USD for every trip but that's not counting fansign stuff Ok that's assuming she's flying from Canada I looked at the tweet again maybe she's a student abroad in korea? So it's cheaper</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
