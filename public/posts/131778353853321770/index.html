THELIVE PLS SNATCH GUNWOOK UP üò≠üò≠ that junwon(?) guy has a face that would look great with gunwooks and hanbins. visual chemistry is important. that other guy (jiwoon(?)) looks like a hao remake. he looks like a twink but thats good since kpop stans dont stan groups that have no twink in them üòÇ no shade to hao or anything. i love my boy matthew BUT his height will be a problem... if matt grows a few inches im on board with this üî•</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
