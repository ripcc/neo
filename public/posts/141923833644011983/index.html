Hanbin always knows at least a bit of bnd&amp;riize activities while meongddo ?? they don't even try to know about zb1 at all. If talking about schedule all them are busy af but hanbin really made an effort that none of them even think about, idk maybe I'm just too deep with the idea of zb1 get look down by others</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And he always watches their stuff and mentions it to them but not explicitly with him but I feel like zb1 in general just make so much effort to be the nice friendly group of 5th gen and they always get treated like the outcasts.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
