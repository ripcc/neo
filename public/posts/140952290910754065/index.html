And I saw another landing failure occurred on jeju air the next day I feel like it has more to do with the airline</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140939640524984641 class=replyLink>/+r/140939640524984641</a>It's so fishy, because they say the black boxes stopped recording when the bird hit the right engine but bird strikes are pretty common? It will never take out a plane if it did we'd have 10 crashes everyday. I'm watching retired pilot youtubers talk about it right now and they were like maybe it's a cover up because it was pilot error and they don't want to admit it. Apparently the bird hit the right engine but during landing the right engine was still on and you can tell because it was emitting those foggy heat waves but the left engine had none of it meaning it was off so they're saying the pilots might've turned off the wrong engine.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-01-23 23:39:24</small></header><p>so the black box stopped right when the issue occurred.. that doesn't sound right. And that makes sense I've only seen people criticizing the airline and most crashes these days are due to company's cutting corners I feel like that could be it alongside pilot issue. Cuz I'm sure if it was just the pilot they would've thrown blame</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
