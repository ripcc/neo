Who? Is it gfriend yerin? I saw a lot of people talked about them but I didn't dig much since it comes from a wanna be sasaeng account.
People said sunwoo and hyunjae sfs are the worst of all. I remember when sunwoo's sf attacked a fangirl just because he replied to her weverse account and what trigger them more is when the other fans praising her for her looks and that she looks like sawako (sunwoo and his sawakok obsession) and many more stories about their jealousy</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

From my experience of being a deobi yh&amp;jy fans kind of have a serious beef between them. I remember they said that one of a korean designer (youngkee something I don't remember his name) is yh's sugar daddy because he is always with him in every brand event which actually not weird since it's his field but I would say that designer is so close with yh enough to make people assume things lol</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
