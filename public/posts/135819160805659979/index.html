There will always be rosins (and allins) who feel their bias is bearing the brunt or the lesser side of the ship and that will never change. And depending on who your bias is I can promise you you will quite literally never ever care to see the other perspective and will always feel your bias is the one people don’t care about when in honest fact haobin is probably one of the first kpop ships in which I can say there is a pretty even spread in which person of that ship is the number 1 bias. Also I’m not sure why your talking to me like I’m a haobinist because I’m not and quite literally anyone whose been in kpop for a while and has a fully developed frontal lobe can tell you this is how it’s been and how it will always be and isn’t unique to this situation. You care for your bias and he’s your bias so obviously anything that negatively effects him is going to be viewed and felt more intensely than similar things happening to other members / other part of the ship but it doesn’t dismiss that it does happen to both party and in diffrent ways and just because you don’t want to acknowledge that doesn’t mean it’s not going to happen.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
