Also the way they put on mask and there was no photo session after getting of the car, I feel like they trying ninja-ing their way to Thai but the news is all over the place already so yeah🤷‍♀️ let's see for their next official schedule flight, if they still act the same then there is a possibility that wk1 told them to. Zb1 is so friendly with the reporters compared to some idols that I've watched the departure video before</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
