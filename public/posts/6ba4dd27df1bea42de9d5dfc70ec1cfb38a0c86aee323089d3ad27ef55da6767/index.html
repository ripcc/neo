But now other chinese zerocolas who know chinese are mad because op never directly said 'making out' so noyb is putting words into their mouth and we all know noyb adds her two cents to make the problem bigger to incite ifans but dont get me wrong zerocolas are still pissed at op for even asking that question they're just mad that the translation isnt accurate making things look 'worst'.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
