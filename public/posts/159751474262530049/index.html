And let's be real we all know those innocent beloved oppas be watching singles inferno too. For me he gives 'hopeless romantic dreamer' but he's been hurt and not hurt specifically from like an ex but just his upbringing in general, probably leeches trying to use him cause he's rich ðŸ˜­ so he has trust issues and it lines up because he's so introverted and explains why his circle is so small yet even then he still prefers to chill by himself most of the time. He's not my bias but totally my type, the kind where he's really independent with 2 close friends but once he finds a girl who can break his walls that he can trust he'll give her his all and that's the vibes I get from watching him and hearing his past anecdotes here.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
