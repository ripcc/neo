And it has private qrts. Can anyone who knows korean tell what this mentally ill bitch is telling him.... I used translator but I couldn't understand anything. Her friend is telling hb that nari is so upset and uncomfortable these days. Also did she also say that he didn't notice because why is hb apologizing. I remember some fans not liking her because of a past fancall where she asked him to get abs comparing him to other idols saying their abs look good in front of his face. The most weird thing is she posted the fancall in weibo saying the other fans will hate her if she posted it in twitter. This bitch is aware that she is mentally ill</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
