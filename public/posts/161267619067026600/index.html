I think rosins believe he will sign with them and that Duhua will be more involved in his future career than yuehua korea? But I don't see how that'll work when he wants to be a kpop artist. Atp who knows what will happen. I used to believe yuehua kr would redebut yuehuaz as a group but now I'm more inclined to believe Duhua will want Hao to be a soloist. It would be better if they all leave that shithole of a company because the way the korean branch managed all their groups tells me yuehuaz bg would be mistreated and mismanaged until they become inactive like UNIQ. Yuehuaz stans can delude themselves and say their boys are smarter than that and will negotiate good contracts and be the exception but that's just cope.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
