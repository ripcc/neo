For one why are you asking them to plagiarise (Kepler moving to klap) when itâ€™s literally still wakeone staffðŸ˜­ but also half of the things keplians are cheering about are shit zb1 already got / do. Like xiaoting being able to do more work in China, c line already do that. Going to shows like koms, Taerae already did that. Acting, jiwoong was already allowed to do that (the good bad liar thing. Having a pre release, zb1 had sweat. The only thing we donâ€™t have is personal instas and it makes perfect sense why, changing agency wouldnt change that. While they are under a temporary contract they are working with the idea that they will be going back to their og agencies and most of the boys og agencies wonâ€™t want them to have individual social media, not now and not if they redebut into groups till a least a while after. The only reason Kepler got solo instas is because they are staying together and obviously have extended for quite a while to the point their og companies see it more beneficial for them to have instas in the group. I canâ€™t understand zerose like we already have more then Kepler give it a couple months and still see if your begging for them to move under what is essentially wakeone 2.0</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
