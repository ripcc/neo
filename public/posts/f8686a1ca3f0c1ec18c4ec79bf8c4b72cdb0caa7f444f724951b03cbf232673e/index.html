That would be some wicked dark shit icl but I wouldn't be surprised if yuehua did just cuz they send trainees to almost every mnet survival. It would be even weirder if they didn't make it and had to be put with the group too omg why would you even think of this ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the only company I see sending trainees is yuehua and maybe wakeone im ngl everytime I go on xhs I see a post about these young seemingly handsome wakeone trainees that get spotted by fans either wakeone will create their own bg OR they're gonna send them</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
