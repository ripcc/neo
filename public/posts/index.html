The hate was so severe that it was also starting to affect the entire group, and it got worse when yiren posted pro-china stuff on her weibo like the fallen chinese soldiers in the korean war and the xinjiang controversy. Cnetz on the other hand were very supportive of her and mass followed her on weibo for refusing to kneel to the koreans and for being a patriot. THAT was the beginning of everglow's downfall bc it was right after that that yuehua shipped yiren to china and put everglow on an indefitine hiatus. Duhua probably thought it was the perfect time to start yiren's solo career in china since koreans hated her and she was receiving a lot of support from cnetz, but she flopped in china too and eventually was shipped back to korea.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I think rosins believe he will sign with them and that Duhua will be more involved in his future career than yuehua korea? But I don't see how that'll work when he wants to be a kpop artist. Atp who knows what will happen. I used to believe yuehua kr would redebut yuehuaz as a group but now I'm more inclined to believe Duhua will want Hao to be a soloist. It would be better if they all leave that shithole of a company because the way the korean branch managed all their groups tells me yuehuaz bg would be mistreated and mismanaged until they become inactive like UNIQ. Yuehuaz stans can delude themselves and say their boys are smarter than that and will negotiate good contracts and be the exception but that's just cope.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
