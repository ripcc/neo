<small>2025-02-05 20:28:30</small></header><p>Erm his gig as the emca mc was never the justification this was all happening anyways and they put him at the forefront of individual schedules DAY 1 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ so no it was never a springboard he was already there. I rlly gotta wonder if yall actually saw how things played out from the beginning trust me this isn't hard for anyone to admit lol and the fact that there's a better distribution now and for the past year is clear enough that we don't need to twerk on this discussion everyday ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ he'll probably still get more than most members but who is shocked or questioning that at this point lol even distribution has never existed in kpop</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
