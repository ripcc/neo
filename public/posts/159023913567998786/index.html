<small>2025-03-14 17:56:15</small></header><p>have you ever been to uni cuz that is not how it works 😭... he cant become a psychologist after taking 1 year of courses he just switched his major to complete a 4 yr degree. Which means he'd probably get a bachelors with a major and minor I'm sure korea operates somewhat differently than what I know but it should roughly be like that</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/159018412079798929 class=replyLink>/+r/159018412079798929</a>From what I’ve been told in Korea you can self study for a year and then theirs a national
Exam period and you sit that exam and if you pass you get a bachelor’s degree. My understanding is that this is completely separate from his DIMA degree because he’s already finished and graduated that. But yeah not just for him but to legally practice as a psychologist in most countries including kr you’d need a masters and then a doctorate if your going into specific roles. Even a counsellor would need a masters. It’s a good degree to have though, it teaches alot that can be self applied and make you more self aware also idol life aside its a good degree for people who want to go into hr/ marketing / management so I guess you could say it’s a good thing to have / be studying as a leader</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
