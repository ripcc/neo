Like there are full grown adults under there (I’m speaking in general) that can and are cosplaying as people that look nothing like themselves and are even hiding their ages. You don’t know if someone you stan has controversies from the past or have done something messed up that would otherwise make you dislike them. It creates this level of protection and inability to hold someone accountable that can be detrimental. And call me superficial but if I’m supporting someone I want to know what they look like, I want to see how they engage in person with other people (are they rude or is their body language hostile in interactions? In that case it’s easier to drop them). I want to put a name to someone’s face and if they are artists I want to see them live at concerts or events. I want to see how they react to things and the way they view the world. I get the VR’s purpose is so it protects their privacy and lets fans project what they actually look like onto them without being disappointed with how they actually look like, but it just seems so, dare I say, idiotic and/or stupid?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

You pretty much get how it works but it's just gonna be a case to case thing like I'm similar to you if I'm stanning someone I want to know how they operate in the real world and I'll even dig deep to make it feel rawer? but yea if the whole character fantasy doesn't work for you it'll never make sense I'm kind of in between since I've been into both things but I like something real and tangible way more</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
