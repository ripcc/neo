Like, the staff is working for the company and idols. But the company is working for the idols, to make them into idols and basically spoon feeding everything and investing millions to try to make them successful and in return the idols give them the monetary benefits of their fame.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-03-20 09:51:46</small></header><p>Yea I get your point the public reaction was basically the same saying how can a celeb be included in the same bracket as people who work minimum wage just to make livings. Which I understand but it also just puts children at risk when they're placed in these ambiguous boxes since that's what a lot of these idols are. I don't totally disagree with it but it's just jarring to hear especially when it was case of a company abusing their power</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
