Jisung for nct dream and soobin for txt being highest are also actually different from what I expected too I thought it would be one of mark/haechan and yeonjun. Also zb1 are so expensive for a 5th gen group?? We're basically matching nct dream</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
