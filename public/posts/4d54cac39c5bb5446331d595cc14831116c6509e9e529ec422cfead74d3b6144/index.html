That age is when they're going through so much confusion and they tend to do shit, idol or not. But there will be difference if an idol started training young before or during that age because if they're gearing to idols, they should know how to present themselves since the industry is fucked up. Very good example, Hao and Wonyoung. When Hao was 13, he didn't know that he'll be a Kpop idol. He was just living his normal teenage life which could get him hated easily if he happened to be Korean. Meanwhile, Wonyoung started so young . She knew what she wanted and made sure that any bitch will only find how professional of an idol she is ever since she decided to go that path. But yes, let's criticize all the adult idols who are still doing shit knowing that they should be protecting themselves, especially if they're in a group because they accepted this life. Whatever they do will affect not only themselves but their groupmates or future groups too. I'm talking about Uncle.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
