A GROUP WHICH WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO SEE AGAIN AND THEY GET HARDLY ANY OPPORTUNITIES TO BE A GROUP TOGETHER NOW IN THE VERY LIMITED TIME THEY HAVE. LIKE THANKS A LOT WAKEONE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED, YOU'RE SPENDING THEIR TIME SO WISELY</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
