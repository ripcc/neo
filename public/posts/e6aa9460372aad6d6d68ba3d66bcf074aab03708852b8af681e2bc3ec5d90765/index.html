I think I might hurt myself if we have to watch him just waste away potential wise like I want him to stay an idol for a while but who know how long that'll last UGHHHHHHHH it's crazy how he was able to whip that snippet up within a couple hours and it was actually good and we got other people threatening to release music oh ok..</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
