I do think that your cc is kinda big but idk how big bc people in zb1 circle hasn't reached the lows of admitting that they come and lurk into cc unlike with x1 on where the group disbanded so nobody gave a fuck about admitting it. Also the X1 boys had crazy sasaengs so we had more tea about them over there, while for zb1 there's tea but most of it comes from pre-bp eras.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
