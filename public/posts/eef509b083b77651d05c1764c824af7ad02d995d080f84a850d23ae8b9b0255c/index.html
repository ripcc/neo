I'm assuming the manager lives downstairs and not up so yjn would've probably had to share if he stayed there so he came up and tartar let him have a big room that's just how I see it gwk also probably just wanted to keep his room</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
