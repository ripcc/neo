They also prescribed me heavy narcotics that would make anyone high as a kite. Speaking hurt, my face was bruised yellow and purple, and whenever I did talk my stitches would yank and swell and istg it hurt my flesh. Bruising didnâ€™t appear that much until the day after but like forcing anyone to work the same day after a surgery is insane. He should be resting for like 2-3 days no schedule and then return with limited speaking roles or position. No flights for like 5-7 days. This is reminding me when FNC Entertainment forced a P1Harmony member (Theo or jiung?) to do a fansign the same day as their wisdom teeth removal and they had to speak to like so many fans to the point they were talking about like swallowing their blood during the event in a live or bubble after ðŸ˜­</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
