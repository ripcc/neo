I rlly liked Ricky and Matthew's too I already forgot what half the group was wearing so I can't rmbr yjns but the fits weren't too bad with the stage it looked more jarring in the mcountdown video. I'm just wondering if this has a choreo or not I was watching the fancam and I could see gwk dancing but maybe it's not to the full song idk</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
