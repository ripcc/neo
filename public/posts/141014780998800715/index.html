So I guess the fight manifested from something else cuz neither tr or gwk were making it awk but I really hated that it was so myngj centered ughhh</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140935025502933170 class=replyLink>/+r/140935025502933170</a>it wasnâ€™t myungjae centered ðŸ˜­ i watched daechinso and he wasnâ€™t involved much in the conversations his attention were mostly looking on the phone to read fans comments kinda hate him for doing that bcz when bnd came hanbin tried his best to involve every bnd member and show interest towards the group so the conversation feels more natural but jaehyun didnâ€™t even ask one question to zb1 and hanbin was doing all the talking it almost feels like he didnâ€™t really like the group</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
