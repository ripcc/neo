Rose head is literally the size of her like torso and is somewhat disproportionate. Ricky has a long face but it’s somewhat negated by how tall he is even tho it kinda still looks a little long. Lara from Katseye is similar. Jiwoong’s head isn’t necessarily big but his narrow shoulders make it seem moreso. Gunwook got a thick neck and wider jaw but his looks natural and it actually isn’t bad at all (this isn’t just because he’s your fave - he looks fineeeee). But yeah. I notice it the most with Rose and Lara, probably because they have thinner waists due to being girls but it’s pretty noticeable.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

NFNNDNDMMD AND GAG IT HIS PROPORTIONS DOWN TO THE HEAD ARE TEAAAAAA he just has a wider face like he's not a bobble head please and I think for Lara I think it's cuz she has a shorter torso her legs are rlly long</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
