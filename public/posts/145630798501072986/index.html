<small>2025-02-05 20:28:30</small></header><p>Erm his gig as the emca mc was never the justification this was all happening anyways and they put him at the forefront of individual schedules DAY 1 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ so no it was never a springboard he was already there. I rlly gotta wonder if yall actually saw how things played out from the beginning trust me this isn't hard for anyone to admit lol and the fact that there's a better distribution now and for the past year is clear enough that we don't need to twerk on this discussion everyday ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ he'll probably still get more than most members but who is shocked or questioning that at this point lol even distribution has never existed in kpop</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/145624605737048254 class=replyLink>/+r/145624605737048254</a>Iâ€™m actually more shocked and confused why people think jobs have ever been equal for literally any kpop group in existence when they havenâ€™t. Like Iâ€™ve accepted that regardless of rank/ popularity/ company literally anything. Mnet like hanbin. Itâ€™s undeniable, they like him and he fits what they want for their stuff so it really doesnâ€™t matter about background at all because like queef and other anons have said other managements have the same and if not more involvement in the group. They were still going to choose him because they like him and thatâ€™s just how it is.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
