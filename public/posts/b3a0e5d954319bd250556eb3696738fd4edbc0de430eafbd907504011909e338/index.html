And the photo was taken on hanbin’s phone so they deffo knew it was him because Matthew has a Samsung. Idk I just think if the company had the foresight to not let them post on bubble the whole day after overlooking that detail seems stupid af but then again this is wakeone. But like anon said at least kfans are being reasonable this time for both hb and gw and realising how insane it is to say they have a political stance over hoodies both have been spotted wearing for weeks beforehand.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
