Like don’t get me wrong I’m not saying guys can’t enjoy being cute or that all idols hate fansigns/fancalls (some do look pretty happy), but if I was knee deep in a busy career and sore from practicing until 5am the same day and heard a rich stalker ask me to say that they’re my master I’d kill myself in front of them. I’ve seen videos of idols putting on the most ridiculous costumes and forcing an awkward smile, I’ve watched the cursed Vernon fancalls, and I’ve seen numerous expressions of pure regret on idol’s faces. And numerous times idols have cried at the events because fans have said rude or mean things. Like just imagine. I’d need at least 20 grams of sativa to deal with it all, even if they were paying me.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
