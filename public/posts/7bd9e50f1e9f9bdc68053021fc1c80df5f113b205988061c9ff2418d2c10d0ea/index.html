With the way people talked about it I thought it was some dodgy place but it actually looks pretty nice for a small company. I think they have two buildings (pledis old building for groovl1n and a new one that was built for the l1ve) Iâ€™m pretty sure this is the one hb is at because after the finals they had his pics and debut video they shot playing on that screen thing at the entrance. Itâ€™s also like bang in the middle of gangnam near the Han river and Also funny thing itâ€™s like literally up the road from yuehua ent like literally 1 road</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
