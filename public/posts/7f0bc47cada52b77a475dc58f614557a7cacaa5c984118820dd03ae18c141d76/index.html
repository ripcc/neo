It's possible they're being selective not only with brands but magazines too, like, arena homme china said they wanted to work with hao again and give him a solo cover, I think they said this around march? and since then rosins have dmed them asking for updates and basically ah+ keeps saying they want him but are waiting for the company's confirmation? the last time they asked was in september. And at first everyone thought wk1 was being shitty but then madame figaro announced hao's cover so now I'm thinking wk1 or yh might be purposefully ghosting ah+ because they're not a high tier magazine in china? they're way below l'officiel and madame figaro.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
