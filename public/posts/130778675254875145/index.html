It was actually pretty calm till around 1pm that's when most people came and I don't think I've ever been somewhere that packed because it's also a very popular mall so you can imagine 15k people plus regular mall goers I was getting overstimulated. But checking in and getting seated was really easy and quick my view was soooo gaggy and it took so long to start ugh Now onto the performances First was Lee youngji she's actually a good performer and she can sangggg Izna.. we might have to stop the hate they're rlly pretty and great performers Baemon was lame as fuck DONT PERFORM SHIT SONGS. Ahyeon doesn't stand out in the slightest chiquita and asa were ending her the high note was booboo Illit were dancing to nursery rhyme beats and dressed in infant clothing it was weird ðŸ˜­ but I get why the group is centered around wonhee the rest of them aren't shit UGH SORRY TO FALL VICTIM BUT I LOVEDDDDD NCT WISH STEADY and lowkey been keeping an eye on them the little dance break was cute and tbh only 2 of them stick out it's sion and sakuya but the song was rlly fun and I listen to it Riize were riize it didn't feel too special and I would've preferred their other songs like love119... really??? It was boring till the end wonbin was right in front of me and he was so cute but that's rlly it like damn that was regular asf poond was shit on a plate and I wasn't even trying to be a hater like they actually cannot perform or dance or sing ðŸ˜­... the girl next to me was a poond fan had a lightstivk and all and didn't even record or turn it on idk if they were paying ppl but it was a booty stage Zbwon... my heart was beating sooo fast but they performed at the stage I couldn't see at AND THEY CAME TO THE MIDDLE TO PERFORM THE OTHER WAY I WAS SOOOOO FRICKING SAD ðŸ˜­ðŸ’” they turned around for the last chorus and to make matters worse.. gwks stage was also at the stage I couldn't see omg I wanted to cry but they're actually so cute and perfect and fun they got good cheers but the people around me were saying they could tell they love being on the stage ayeeee New jeans only for screams in the beginning the first part was boring but it picked up and they're sooo fricking cute and pretty and hanni and Danielle kept interacting with my section wow I rlly have to fuck with these queens forever I laughed at yunjins intro for lsfm they're trying too hard with the concept ðŸ˜­ omg I had to let the eunchae hate go guys...
