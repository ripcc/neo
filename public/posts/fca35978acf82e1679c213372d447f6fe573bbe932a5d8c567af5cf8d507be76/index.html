No one knew he went to Shanghai but I remember someone here linked a picture of Ricky and Yuehua staff inside the airport office posted by an airport employee on xhs ðŸ’€ (probably to finalize his documents since he had visa issues hence why he couldn't go to AAA). So that's how we knew he went to Shanghai for a day while the other were in Philippines for AAA and then I remember someone cross posting a weibo post calling out his csasaengs after he came back to Korea but me too I don't remember a video I just saw multiple weibo and xhs posts saying what anon said his csasaengs did and said to him and ops weren't fans of Ricky just passerby's at the airport and found the situation absurd.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
