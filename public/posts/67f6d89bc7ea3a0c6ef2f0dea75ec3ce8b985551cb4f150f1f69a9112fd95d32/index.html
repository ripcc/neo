I've always been on the side of new jeans and tbh I don't even hate mhj sure things can be said about her relationship w new jeans I don't even think it's that sinister but clearly this is bigger than anyone anticipated</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
