His k fans lowkey mean to him if he steps outside the image they have of him so haobin and the underwear story , even though both were completely fine and normal , has his k fans tweaking out because that doesnâ€™t align with the image they want him to present</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
