Mostly with international fans and the constant boycotting. Like, they must feel like they wasted Wonbin and Sungchan and Anton in the group, the rest of them are forgettable but like Sungchan has an insane amount of gf stans, Anton's a nepo baby with a super handsome face, and Wonbin has such an amazing face (even if you personally disagree, I (and most people) are gagged the first time they see him before he talks, plus his face fits so many korean beauty standards so some people ignore the fact he's short). I wonder where the group would stand internationally had they never debuted Seunghan to begin with and never had such a big scandal. They also revealed some new SM male trainees recently and I've been seeing some old-RIIZE twitter users change their profile pics to the trainees and already move on. The kpop cycle is so brutal akdljflakdj</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
