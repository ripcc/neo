Here with Taerae :<blockquote class=twitter-tweet><a href="https://twitter.com/traelxve/status/1850856805196546225?t=lrT821t-VsIW-VXDip68rg&amp;s=19"></a></blockquote>Here with Gunwook it looks very natural tbh.<blockquote class=twitter-tweet><a href="https://twitter.com/ay_lafyuu/status/1853212803341197475?t=xGGGyCbVoKO0uehZY2ge1A&amp;s=19"></a></blockquote><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><a href="https://twitter.com/yujin_ke/status/1853417783184478559?t=xyw3cqBXuZ4CHwmm6Zsozg&amp;s=19"></a></blockquote>Here with ricky :<blockquote class=twitter-tweet><a href="https://twitter.com/yuehuazip/status/1853389151804010663?t=0Fm28mYS87VktsA8gVLA3g&amp;s=19"></a></blockquote>You can skip the link but my point here is He is more natural with taerae and gunwook, ricky and Matthew too, I find yujin is just doing fanservice with hao because it doesn't come out to be very natural. Rosins akagae apparently using those luckyz moments to hate on other member so they wanted to create or equivalent ship like 2binz out of luckyz ðŸ˜Ÿ</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
