These koreans (not gp) only care about them, and will ignore zb1 even if they give them good songs. I hope wk1 resorts to some sajaegi and does a lot of promo this time. Or else this cb will be a failure too, the boys actually want to give us a gp hit song but it can only happen with good promo.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Zb1 were the one who revived their hype for a bit. Riize got lucky with their debut and hybe is manipulating the charts for their bgs. Jyp is debuting a nbg soon but they have zero hype. Anyways 4gen bgs have proved that you don't need the korean gp to hit big and zb1 have probably the strongest kfandom among the 5gen after plave, they only get discredited because they're under wk1.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
