The real reason why Zeroses are beefing with Ahgases is because of Rosins. Lemme break it down: some rosins posted that they'll be voting for got7 so zeroses are pissed.
-ahgases asked bambam to help them promote the voting. zeroses were pissed because they think it's unfair since it will draw their fans. he is the most followed kpop soloist in X.
-zb1 won. some ahgases posted that it's ok since zb1 will be disbanding anyway. zeroses were mad saying that ahgases were wishing for zb1 to disband (ðŸ˜³)
-while the above is happening, zeroses were directly quoting bambam & being mean then later said that they were just joking
-the fight intensified because rosins were siding with ahgases and zeroses think that they shouldn't be doing it because they're wishing for zb1 to disband and hao is there
-then bambam replied a laughing emoji on ahgase's post about fighting. zeroses were mad saying that he's being mean to zb1 (i'm sorry i don't get the correlation)
-he was then told that the post he replied to was about ahgases fight with zeroses so he deleted the emoji post and apologized. i saw a post saying that he didn't say sorry and only apologized (ðŸ˜­)
-bambam deleted the apology post. probably upon checking that zeroses were quoting him with mean captions. calling him pedophile (it was the show's mistranslation as per ahgase) and telling him that he should have killed himself.
-ahgases are so mad now because they think that zeroses are too much by directly attacking bambam when they didn't do it with zb1 and the only drag they say is disbandment which they find funny because it was ZB1's contract. *i do think that rosins should be called out for proudly saying that they're voting for got7. then, zeroses should also be called out for directly quoting an artist with mean captions. and ahgases should stop and be the bigger persons. It's sad because we ruined a good relationship when dr dr has 0 chance of winning any music show because it has no physical points</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
