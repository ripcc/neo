The driver license pic of him idk 16? in LA to 20 is also a good comparison because everything is the same. People need to hop of his dick 😭 because the plastic surgery agenda with him is so forced if you actually look at his predebut stuff and screams insecurity. Also people forget he's chinese and a lot of chinese faces are more sculpted so lowkey some racism because in their minds they think asians can only have flat features :S /+r/135775162237931811</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

(why would it take him 7 months to realize this.) there's absolutely nothing in my room right now. just the floor.
