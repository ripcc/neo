Anyway they were mad at that but then clocked it was the same account that said it was a hanbin fan who told Matthew to move at khan and then later confirmed it was actually gyuvin fan but wouldn’t delete the og post. Then people clocked how they post every zb1 duo but Mattbin (so people just clocked that user doesn’t like hanbin) kinda like how mono will post every Gunwook duo but mattparkz 💀 like it ain’t slick. The whole Matthew debut because of hanbin wasnt anything to do with actual bp but more so if he hadn’t convinced him to join he would have gone back to Canada ect. I guess they used it this time because they mentioned it recently. /+r/be553ab4be</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Yk how he was when they just debuted and was practically begging to marry fans and gave some of the most intense and like romantic eye contact I’ve ever seen an idol do at fansigns? And now he’s constantly (without ANY shame) saying to his fans to post his photos to their Instagram and say he’s your boyfriend? There was a tweet going around predebut that said something like “gunwook looks cold and intimidating but if you look hard enough in his eye you see someone so eager to please and love and to be loved he can’t control it” and it’s so amazing how that hasn’t changed after being a full fledged idol. Sure what he does is like crack to sasaeng’s but irregardless he’s such a sweet and eager kid, idk how anyone could legitimately hate him. He’s also so smart and sweet it’s heartwarming. I totally get why he’s a social butterfly and every mentor loves him. Truly one of the greats and I really do feel bad for those that randomly hate him. They’re missing out on stanning someone amazing, and actually talented, way above the average standard. Plus he’s super handsome.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>glook</strong>
<small>2024-11-22 03:27:58</small></header><p>omg right it's so charming 😭🩷🩷 he's always been the type to ask to be loved openly in a really miskeen way and I'm glad that soft part of him is still around even though he's been through a lot I gotta give it to him he's resilient as fuck he's the shyest beg ever it's so cute ugh don't make me tear uppp. he's rlly the quintessential idol and his heart is huge it's crazy I don't really see that many people be emotionally in tune with themselves at that age like he is AND EXACTLYYYYYY HES THE FULL FARKING PACKAGE SAY THATTTTT EVERYBODY THAT HATES HIM IS A SAD SAD SOUL</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#5691</span>
