He’s lucky tho that he lost it all young because while his skin is stretchy he doesn’t have loose skin that most people do who lose a lot of weight later in life because the skin still holds a lot of collagen till around 25 ish then it gets harder to get rid of excess skin</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And there was massive speculation that Gucci ancora in China was only supposed to be hao which lowkey checks out now because Ricky’s the only member who went to that event that’s never been sponsored by Gucci since or gone to one of their events. It really wouldn’t surprise me if it took so long because yuehua wanted it to be a Luckyz thing esp since it’s a China schedule and that’s where they have a lot of power. Also funny to bring it up at this time because there’s actually a pic going round of hao using a yuehua staff phone and the case is Luckyz zeroninis 😂</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
