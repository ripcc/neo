No there's a large distance between pits and stages to avoid that if the members can recognize their favorite fansites from pits I think they can see pretty clearly but yea it's easy to give a personal perspective to a group of people that's why people always get confused on who got special interactions and who didn't like those rosins and hao.

It’s not just about his recent live where he talked about going to the Prada event; he’s discussed not drinking several times out of nowhere in the past with nothing, not even comments, asking about it. And like it’s totally chill to hate alcohol but I’m looking at him with a raised eyebrow given the super religious cult rumors about his family and the context that provides. I also look weird at idols who speak too much about drinking too. Idk man. I feel like he has some religious trauma based off the way he interacts, operates, and handles others boundaries. For one of my sociology classes in college, a professional cult researcher gave a talk breaking down the way those raised in super religious upbringings interact with outside perspectives (unusually high defensiveness, failure to understand common boundaries, assumption that others innately believe their beliefs, virtue signaling, a type of boisterous interpersonal connection, etc.) and it’s ringing a few bells with him. It’s one thing to let your religion influence your consumption beliefs, which is pretty normal imo, but this isn’t just that; it’s so much more. I’m super interested to see how he’s going to be in 15 years and if he’ll mellow out more or pull a Siwon from Super Junior and outright talk and promote harsh religious beliefs. Do I think he’s a crazy, evil religious recruiter? Hell no. Am I seeing signs of religious trauma? Absolutely. And I don’t think anyone would argue Gyuvin, especially at debut, acted like a normal idol.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-31 08:27:34</small></header><p>HE ISSSS THATS LIT WHAT HES DOINGGG we were talking about how he doesnt seem practicing and i think hes just take on some beliefs as a cultural thing like for ex i feel like a lot of agnostics that were previously raised in deeply religious households still hold on to values whether its conscious or subconscious so it could be like that for him. Everything just seems like a mix of guilt and like you said some kinda of past event and the cult theory didnt sound wild at all sooooo yea but i can see him mellowing out gyuvins just kinda like that as a person but he tries and he learns</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#3137</span>

Matthew is easier to style than Taerae though despite being shorter because his proportions are more typical and balanced. Gyuvin is just long everywhere and like yujin has one of the thinnest waists ever. Jiwoong has narrow shoulders proportionate to his head but they do pretty good with him, Ricky has a long neck but that isn’t too bad and Hao is pretty balanced. Gunwook is pretty balanced too but he has a wider rib cage and athletic build so they give him baggier pants which I don’t like 24/7. Also the stylists gotta get more creative with Gyuvin and dress him more mature. You got someone who has one of the rarest physiques out there, maybe experiment and stop dressing him in glorified preppy Adam Sandler core. I wanna see him in more trench coats, turtle necks, better hair styling, etc. Winter is coming so I’m hoping the cold weather means better layering and styling.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
