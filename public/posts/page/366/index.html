It has been long since he last did a live, I have been seeing a lot of gyuvin live clips on my tl than hanbin's. I feel so starved, I thought he'd do it today. And the dc allins aren't demanding him for any live broadcast these days. Why are they acting all nice now? I just saw a post saying they would like to see him do live broadcast but they aren't spamming him in pluschat asking for it anymore. Those dc girls have been in their best behavior lately despite the drought.

Also I saw a mca live broadcast review in korean talking something about "wakeone hanbin saying he will be pictorial or wtv" (I couldn't understand, but it had the words wakeone hanbin and pictorial)...
