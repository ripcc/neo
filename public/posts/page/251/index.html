So did wakeone unban him for 5 mins and put him back on the ban because he never came after that? Dumbass riyangis say wakeone only lets him come onto pchat to talk about brand stuff but what brand was he promoting at the airport 10 days ago? So why did wakeone let him talk about uniskin but not katokato on pchat? Like it's sooooooooooooo fucking stupid and makes zero sense.

Like, okay, min hee Jin is weird, but everyone now saying she’s a prostitute for saying in her texts that she might sleep with someone if it makes the HYBE/New Jeans conflict easier cannot have a complex thought to save their lives. 1. Even if she was a prostitute, why are you shaming her and not the men? 2. If she’s willing to sell her body to help New Jeans, then doesn’t that speak to how much she’s willing to do for them? Like, she’s already selling her house to help with the fees. She’s literally throwing her life away if this doesn’t work out. That’s desperation, not just for herself but for those girls, and I think it should be somewhat admired rather than people slutshaming her. I would only ever do that if it was a life or death situation for my family. Maybe actually think for a second how intense things are for her to go that far? 3. She was gross for having an affair with that married guy but once again, that doesn’t involve new jeans and the dude wasn’t in HYBE, therefore it was just her messy business so it’s irrelevant unless someone is trying to confirm their bias. Also she isn’t a fucking idol, she’s a director who chose to go super public to protect her craft and new jeans. Now HYBE/BTS Stan’s are looking at any photos new jeans took with men and inferring that they are prostitutes and that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree… not to speak ill but maybe yeontan V’s dog passing away was karmaaaa</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And we know that companies heavily push their idols to do/say some things for pr in zb1 it's very obvious as they're an especially controlled group
-Zb1 have had multiple appearances overseas last year and even earlier this year, but there was a switch that happened in my opinion somewhere this year specifically I think it was partially influenced by the clout zb1 got when they interacted with fans in Japan, partially due to new company strategies
-The shift is with how they present themselves publicly, when the members are overseas they usually have to have staffs around them at all and they usually need to be covered up yet for ex in macau, almost the entire group was just walking in the mall maskless, this is super inconvenient and isn't something that would have happened last year
-I think the easiest example is luckyz because everyone knows they're a very obviously pushed "pr" duo, I thought them hanging out in Japan last time and posting literally all the time was obvious enough (bcs members who organically hang out do not make that much content out of it it would usually be from a schedule), but again today they went out in public completely maskless and "visible clothes" even tho these two arguably have the most ssngs, afaik the only time luckyz have hung out in seoul was during the yhz dinner, it is obvious then esp when you compare the sightings of ggyuvin hanging out alone and hanbin w staffs where they actively make an effort to hide, that they are being massively seen on purpose.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
