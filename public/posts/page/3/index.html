hanbin: he gets an acting gig in a cj drama and is absolute shit or he gets a major variety gig passed on from someone famous where hes too boring
hao: some type of nationalism controversy that makes either chinese or korean ppl really mad lowkey a right of passage for cn idols
matt: idk he’ll prob suffer from the switch up most ppl have on english speaking idols after saying something vaguely controversial/cringe or him being too nice to everyone that talks to him is gonna lead to someone taking advantage of him
taerae: filler addiction/bad ps, shading zb1 members
ricky: drops a clothing line thats super basic but really overpriced and gets called out for scamming fans, tries acting but is super stiff and awkward
gyuv: being nugu is gonna hit him hard and he’ll be going on live for 2-3 hours a day saying stupid shit that gets him in trouble and he’ll be too old for fans to coddle him
gwk: idk hes forever a troll victim but he might get sloppy abt hiding that hes dating
yujin: his kfans get pissed as fuck that hes too close to his cfans and yuehua will also cater more to his rich cfans adding to it, vaping</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I was in a fandom with a severe akgaes case. When the group exists, those akgaes were so loud, fighting for 'my bias is the most relevant' and keeping the 'my bias sold out/sell goods the most' race. When the group disbands, these akgaes gone like GONE and move on to another idol with nice akgaes field to fight in. They just love those adrenaline rush from fighting and feeding their overinflated ego by thinking their bias 'winning' as their own achievement in life because irl they are losers or unhappy individuals and their bias achievement is the only thing they could have in life. Which is funny because when they logged off, no one care about all that and they are still the same sad, loner loser. This shit is applicable for all akgaes not limited to zb1</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
