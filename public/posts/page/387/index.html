For example you guys are still blaming w1 for his mic (not in ears) when it was his weibo cbars fault who scammed fans and everyone knows that except for you guys because you guys only want to blame w1. So is his mistreatment on valid if it's w1 fault? Where were the #FUCKRICKYSCBAR hashtags? Hmmm I didn't see any. And you riyangis all up riding noyb and ttopaz dick when they knew the real reason all along but never told you guys because they didn't want to ruin chinese ris reputation.... they care more about ris reputation then ricky and kept their mouth shut when they saw yall blame wakeone looking dumb af. It's like you guys pick and choose and add in a bunch of unrelated shit so when passerbys sees it they see all the bullshit and never take it seriously like this instance, Gunwook literally mentioned Ricky yesterday and said his part was his favorite or something yet you guys blatantly ignore it because it doesn't fit your agenda. Like no shit its obvious Ricky is mistreated but you guys claim every. single. thing. as mistreatment and wonder why no one takes you guys seriously. /+r/139050429576336910</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

For hanbins finsta there was a rumor that he posted a photo that was taken on Haos phone. For the main part of my ask it was talking about Haos wc predebut and after he got close to Hanbin. He had a blank pfp and was seemingly a bit aloof with people but after getting close to Hanbin he kept changing his pfp to different cute/baby pics of hb including hbs fav Pokémon. And being all cute and sappy/having cute arguments with Hanbin. And then said “真正意义上的初恋” (true first love/love in the truest form) about Hanbin soon after. Hao posted moments on WeChat for only his friends and family to see about Hanbin and 2 that I cannot share myself. To the akgae solos who hate them, hao also apparently cussed yall out and protected Hanbin. In china, doing such things is never done by friends and is even rare in relationships. Doing so classifies you as a “love brain” (obsessed with love/your partner) the wc lore goes deep so I’ll stop here lmao… but there’s just too much lore on them I can’t keep up /+r/139035719443370511</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

All I’ll say because requeef doesn’t like Haobin talk much, is the pfp to Hanbin multiple times after it being blank through college (seeing said pics myself and hao confirmed during a mass crash out between their solos… bruh it was crazy) and then calling Hanbin his true first love (came from same op who said the pfp rumor.) there’s tons of other things that I can’t talk about… but that in itself is very clear there’s at least romantic feelings involved. I’ve seen/heard lots of akgaes trying to start something about them with other people or bring up their past but it’s always been proven wrong/unreliable.
