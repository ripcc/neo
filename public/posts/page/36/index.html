A GROUP WHICH WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO SEE AGAIN AND THEY GET HARDLY ANY OPPORTUNITIES TO BE A GROUP TOGETHER NOW IN THE VERY LIMITED TIME THEY HAVE.

YOU DONT HAVE TIME ðŸ˜‘ but walk with me here i feel like we might jumped the gun a bit. everyone was so sure that theyd do an actual world tour 2023-early2024 and it ended up being a Q4 asia tour only and judging off the wording and time frame theyre gonna release ticketing between now and april and have a concert on june or smth. they specifically said "concert" when they called timeless world a "tour" so idk.. and presale is exclusive to the 2nd membership that ends in 2 months so sales have to be starting soon. cmiiw but for reference timeless world was announced around april? and ticketing started around july onwards IDK..
