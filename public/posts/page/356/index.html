Let’s be 100% honest, the group just started releasing not that great music, their vocal tones sound like screeching when they try to reach high notes (especially Yeji), and none of them have like super super unique talents. They lost their relevancy and I doubt they’ll ever regain their popularity. If they were any other group under a non-big 4 company no one would be talking about them. And like it’s really odd because the fans they have left swear on their momma the music is good and that it’s all lies, like let’s take a step back and gauge the audience. The music is mid, and even when they were “good” they were copying early Weki Meki. Itzy did fall off.

For small and mid tier companies they have to outsource compared to big4 where they already have in house choreographers and producers like YG has their own dance crew (ygx), their own producers (teddy before he moved on to tbl), SM has kenzie and whole bootcamps dedicated to make music for their groups and has strong ties with people like bada to make iconic memorable choreo for their groups, hybe is hybe they have a whole ecosystem, idk much about jype but it's probably the same for them too jyp himself used to make music for his groups but he stopped /+r/142092572914046732</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I searched Hao's name yesterday to look for repos for the handshake event and one of his fans posted about not seeing many older women and she was nervous because it's her 1st time without her circle of friends. Her daughter is a Ricky fan and I think she's around 40yo. Another one is an older woman too with her husband (they are so sweet 😭) and a Hanini plushie is hanging on her bag. I want to grow old like them. 😭 I remember during the concert, Jzeroses are posting their kids attending with them. Lots of Hao fans carrying Haninis. I envy Japan because they arent discriminating fans because of their age like what international fans are doing. You know, the "you're pushing 30 blah blah blah..."</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
