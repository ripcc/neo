The driver license pic of him idk 16? in LA to 20 is also a good comparison because everything is the same. People need to hop of his dick üò≠ because the plastic surgery agenda with him is so forced if you actually look at his predebut stuff and screams insecurity. Also people forget he's chinese and a lot of chinese faces are more sculpted so lowkey some racism because in their minds they think asians can only have flat features :S</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
