So like it’s not the same as finding out exactly who sent those asks and blaming them, what they point in starting a fight over something anonymous it’s not like the person will ever feel the direct repercussions of it. I’m just shocked at how nasty and violent and graphic those death threats get especially when I’ve seen a couple in different cc say hb should be put in gaza to be bombed like at that point I don’t even know how people can even adress or respond to that because it really does go beyond mental illness when you use the genocide of a whole race of people to wish death on someone whose never done anything</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I thought Jennie would bank on her international fame and target the ifans then her song will also blow up in Korea. In my mind, Rosé will flop. Lisa is doing what I expected her to do though. Relying on her man. I forgot that Rosé has this businesswoman brain and she really is smart. Get the man charting no.1 on charts. No fucking promo. Just drop the shit and then hit.Jennie is being edgy with her feminism though I do think that she would have hit it big in Korea if Rosé didn't drop Apt. Why drop on the same month btw?
