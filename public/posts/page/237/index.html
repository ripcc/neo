And, NO, before anyone says it’s not because he’s gay or possibly autistic 😒. People using that as an excuse to go against anyone who says anything not favorable about him is annoying. It’s weird because I really think Gyuvin has matured a lot this past year and my impression of him got way better, but as Taerae got more comfortable and got more “shady” I started liking him less. They swapped. I think taerae is a very observant person and actually has foresight and thinks ahead and uses it to his advantage. He’s smart, you can tell. But like he’s smart in a way that can come off as pretentious, and he inserts himself in situations focused on others at times. Saying things like “I wouldn’t have done that…” “NO ONE would think that” “WE would’ve done it different”. Istg he’s done this multiple times in several different variety shows. It’s like asserting yourself and making generalized statements that assume how other people would act or react, which comes off as rude to others who don’t agree with the generalized comment. Most people do it every now and then but it’s rare; Taerae does it fairly often which makes him seem or act a little pretentious. I used to do the same shit in early high school too so I think that’s why I picked up on it but a lot of people don’t notice it. I also noticed on top of the statements, and other people have pointed it out too, his clinginess is a little much. I do think Taerae will mature out of it but who knows. He’s a complex character but people who don’t fuck with him because of these things are super valid.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Not because of the new jeans drama but because their survival show was genuinely some of the most rigged shit ever and like almost none of them have aura or charisma and they seem awkward. I don’t remember which member exactly but one of them has the worst vocal tone I’ve heard in years. And their songs aren’t exceptionally good. Sometimes you can ignore rigged shows if the group is good (aka Fromis_9, super rigged show that got revealed via the court system but they had great songs and good vocals and charismatic members so no one gaf). But illit aren’t like that 😅 I saw a video of them at some even and it was sooooo off</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
