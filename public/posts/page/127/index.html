You cant really compare Airport fits because Idols after a while do have a say in them. Hao had a "custom" made fit for the W Korea event but the fit wasnt custom made with him in mind. It belonged to Xiao. Its a piece he didnt wore which is why I think that Hao is getting dressed by Gucci China and not Gucci Korea but Gucci China and Gucci Korea kind of collaborated to have him on the W Korea event. From what i see its still Woongsungz for Gucci Korea and Hao for Gucci China. I just dont know if Gucci Korea decided to drop Jiwoong because he AGAIN wasnt wearing Gucci</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And the biggest worry was the clashing timelines of the new group debuting and if zb1 have to be involved which is most likely not happening idk it's kind of getting annoying now cuz the show isn't coming for at least another year LETS LEAVE IT ALONEEEEE cuz exactly just like you said there's 0 chance this group is doing well and zb1s known as a miracle group cuz it's not happening again the kpop survival show market is finished it's too early for all this rara</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#3355</span>

With the way people talked about it I thought it was some dodgy place but it actually looks pretty nice for a small company. I think they have two buildings (pledis old building for groovl1n and a new one that was built for the l1ve) I‚Äôm pretty sure this is the one hb is at because after the finals they had his pics and debut video they shot playing on that screen thing at the entrance. It‚Äôs also like bang in the middle of gangnam near the Han river and Also funny thing it‚Äôs like literally up the road from yuehua ent like literally 1 road</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
