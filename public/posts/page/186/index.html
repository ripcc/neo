Though I still think that Ricky looks the best even as a rosin. Hao gagged me like I remember so many repos saying that the first thing you'll see about Hao are his features before his face and it's true lmao. Like I saw his nose, then lips and eyes, then the whole face altogether as it's very eyecatching 😭😭 Ricky's face though. Ooh don't end those who think you don't look good cause he fucking is. Gunwook is like verrryyyyyy ATTRACTIVE in a sense that he knows he's hot and he's acting all cute and hot and he's so attractive and he's so handsome you get what I'm saying???? Yujin is really their visual with his prince features. Like it's really both Ricky and yujin but Ricky just looks more attractive lol Visual ranking after watching them live: Ricky Yujin Hao Gunwook Hanbin (very cute, he really suits fresh image on him lol) Gyuvin (very very puppy like lol especially when he smiles) Uncle (he was 5 or above hanbin during soundcheck but went down to seven when they are on the main concert) Matthew (HOT!!!!)

Not only can she not sing on the show, she’s besties with that Kelly girl who’s obviously being actively rigged in. Their performance was ass and it was so clear the team they won over was better. It’s the nonchalant comfortable nature she has that’s pissing me off because she knows she’s gonna get in no matter what. Where is the passion? Desperation? Like fuck I’d take the evil onepact members over her any day. At least with bahiyyih she could keep up with choreo and looked nervous but showed determination. Fawk Kelly and heuninglea or whatever and their whole squad. Please let the poor other idols who signed onto this hellhole show unknowingly be way more successful than whatever this group will be. Praying for an exposing article be dropped and they get the X1 treatment.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
