On average they’re at the minimum more likely to be superficial, at least looks wise. When everyone in the industry and your coworkers are a 9 or 10/10 and skinny or perfectly fit you’d probably create an unrealistic standard of beauty. Those that started young never had the time to make valuable mistakes (also they are in the public eye, they had to be extra cautious) so they probably lack emotional maturity, common sense, and genuine depth to understand how their mistakes can hurt others. Even the worst idols have devoted fans who console them even when they’re in the genuine wrong, so that’s also a bad thing because it dissuades accountability and gives a sense of confidence of always having support even if they mess up so they can be a little more careless. Ik we joke a lot about “oh I’d trust this idol with my drink” but I genuinely think I wouldn’t trust any male idol. Taeil was always a little weird but no one ever expected him to be a r*pist, you can’t trust men, especially Korean men (have you seen the insane misogynistic and incel statistics they have?).</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Matthew is easier to style than Taerae though despite being shorter because his proportions are more typical and balanced. Gyuvin is just long everywhere and like yujin has one of the thinnest waists ever. Jiwoong has narrow shoulders proportionate to his head but they do pretty good with him, Ricky has a long neck but that isn’t too bad and Hao is pretty balanced. Gunwook is pretty balanced too but he has a wider rib cage and athletic build so they give him baggier pants which I don’t like 24/7. Also the stylists gotta get more creative with Gyuvin and dress him more mature. You got someone who has one of the rarest physiques out there, maybe experiment and stop dressing him in glorified preppy Adam Sandler core. I wanna see him in more trench coats, turtle necks, better hair styling, etc. Winter is coming so I’m hoping the cold weather means better layering and styling.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Even if they graduate high school that’s keeping in mind if they went to a performance or art one there is likely to be less stress on academics, and if they’re currently an idol while being in high school, a lot of their projects and requirements were probably relaxed due to their profession. So even those that make it to high school graduation are probably not all that. I also sort of feel bad when I do hear about smart idols who gave up probably a very normal and professional career to become an idol. I think it was one of the members of the girl group IRRIS who’s studying law at MIT, and I wish I could shake her and ask why she would choose to debut nugu over focusing on her law degree. Like you’re diverting focus that could be put in internships for a super unstable career. I think this is also why I like gunwook so much (he’s my bias in the group) because you can tell he’s actually intelligent and curious about things. He isn’t someone who navigates life indifferent. But yes, if you ever are feeling to delusional just keep in mind they’re just dancers and singers and their knees will be shot by the time they’re 40 years old likely.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
