A part of me feels alot of them are lowkey aware of the rumours too and for the most part just ignore them now ? And like you said not just with zb1 but with all survival groups once they disband a lot of the akgaes will leave. A big reason they even stay here is to feed on that survival mode and competitive instinct, to make everything a competition in the limited time we have left. I can guarantee from most subfandoms whether we like it or not a good chunk will tune into bp 2 and if it lines up with zb1s disbandment a lot will move onto the new survival group .</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And as of now we know the tiktoks Keeho has done with Hao is a big fat zero while his challenges with Matt are reaching double digits, and Hao was wondering if he should apologise during that HaoBin live because Hanbin recognized the P1H song faster than him.....yeah Hao you should apologise to your (fake) boyfriend üíÄ</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
