The shoot was something important ig since he mentioned having his makeup done for it and talking about how he asked the makeup to be gentle. But they definitely could have let him skip the practice like he said he was told not to work out or anything yet he still had to go to practice. Also he mentioned not being given stitches because they are flying out to Japan this week and it could cause complications if the stitches bury due to the pressure so he was fr just bleeding free like maybe I sympathise a bit more because I had mine out recently but I was stuck in bed for 2 days with the worst migraine after I had mine taken out and I think I have quite a high pain tolerance so I can’t imagine having to dance for hours on top of it /+r/15491a139b</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

This was similar with aespa a few years ago with awful shitty choreo and they were unsynchronized as hell but they got rid of their entire stage direction team and replaced them with this amazing japanese stage director and they have memorable choreos and iconic performances now but it took literally years because they were so close to their previous ones but i’m glad they got rid of them</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I don't think zbwon have a bad synchronization problem it was shit during debut yea but they locked in this was just shit AND TBH EVERYONE WILL MOVE ON CUZ THEY GET MADE FUN OF EVERYDAY 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ they really need a director tho im still mad Kepla had one the whole time while they were left for deadddd</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#5128</span>
