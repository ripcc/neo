Also if anything if they didn't like the murican way they coulda dipped long ago cause their schools are probably better than ours too 😭 like u really think they staying here for some ocsa high school diploma 😭 but yeah maybe in 20-30 years when his parents made all the money they want and decide to retire and live a life back in china then yeah they could go back but rn they aint dippin just from everything we know cause their intentions all points to staying permanently.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Hao just from the scene he was in pre debut and although it can be seen as being friendly just him trying to get into idols group chats was hilarious like he'll date for fun. Jiwoong well were assuming he just broke up and he seems okay like he's moved on, he's back to flirting and making music so he'll be in a relationship in no time.
4-6. Hanbin Taerae and Gunwook they give 4-5 relationships before busting out the ring for that special one.
7-9. I feel like these three would probably have 2 or even 1 relationship their entire life.
Gyuvin seems dumb but he can be serious when he means it and he seems like the type to take relationship seriously.
Matthew gives loves at first sight and would do anything to save the relationship never giving up.
Ricky surprisingly if you asked me 1 year ago I'd put him first/ second just from his first impression but getting to know him he seems the most committed as well, he really seems to knows what he wants and is really careful who he lets in his personal life hence why he has only a few friends and he's completely fine with that. /+r/9e3ee4672f</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

He looked fine but obviously in videos in the venue the blonde was barely noticeable and looked all dark which was better. I actually think he looked better today than he has in ages and now that he slimmed out a lot in the face it’s definitely better for him to stick to dark hair rather than light, especially his brows they are dark again ans he looks so much better</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
