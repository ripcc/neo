I can't even cap I BUSTED OUT LAUGHING SEEING THE PREVIEW VIDEO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 like there were tears in my eyes idky like it's obviously not terrible but to me at least the before was much better idk if his skins prepped but he looked perfect already. His features are so strong he looks better with less yes but this makeup artist was playing in his face, I mean it's very easy to get him to look overboard so I'll give her some grace. Ik the concept was to make him look like the photo but she took him to cosplay landia. And yea it's a one time thing you don't gotta worry im pretty sure this is risabae she has a specific style and she does transformations all the time</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140892346320639836 class=replyLink>/+r/140892346320639836</a>Right???
