I think you're confusing the Xinjiang controversy that happened in 2021/2022 for a ban on global brands. Some brands like Nike, Adidas and H&amp;M expressed concern about alleged forced labor and violation of human rights in Xinjiang and said they wouldn't use Xinjiang cotton anymore, and then the chinese general public boycotted them. I think H&amp;M in particular was removed from taobao and other e-commerce stores, but the brands weren't banned from operating in china per se. They're still working in china today, but the general public hates them.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
