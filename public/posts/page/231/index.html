Can't the girls sue? I feel so bad for them. If the trainee debt theory is true, then the Tempest boys probably don't get anything either. Yena, Ricky, Gyuvin, Hao, and Yujin should be ""fine"" because the izone/zb1 money should've been enough to pay all their debt by now, but I'm not sure about Seungeon and Yunseo.

Her bias is still Hanbin and she is also a haobin shipper. But she should be careful about what she posts because from what I saw she obviously likes hao but a little crazy about it.
