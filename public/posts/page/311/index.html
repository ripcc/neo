Belle does the same thing, and moves her chin in the same sort of unnatural way and looks uncomfortable when she opens her mouth fully. I’ve never had a chin implant so I can’t speak 100% on it but it wouldn’t shock me if it’s a little weird to fully open your mouth with it, especially with chin implants that are that big or don’t fit exactly well. The skin is stretched over the extra protruding part, so it makes sense it’s a little tight idk 🤷‍♀️</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I got a few things to add about the Twitter chick zb1leader. She is so weird, I got moots telling me she gets into fansigns, mcd recording, any pre recording etc via illegal ways. She used to "host" group orders on Twitter for joiners to buy so she can use the sales to get into fansigns etc. Apparently a couple of her joiners never got their stuff and she would claim on Twitter how she's on hiatus. Meanwhile on her TikTok and other sns accounts, you see her attending a bunch of zb1 concerts from south kroea to Japan to other Asia countries. She's also friends with the other Twitter account mycathao who recently complained about how foreigners not getting into the showcase. Either way that zb1leader is a weirdo. She's always saying how hanbin recognizes her and how other members also know she's hanbins fan. /+r/147009090000999136</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
