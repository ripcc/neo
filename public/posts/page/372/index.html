Like obviously they’re going to have a strategy to make the member least liked in a group likable again and to gain some more popularity (using Seungkwan to warm up Joshua’s perception), what’s so wrong with that??? Just send them to a few variety shows and make him likable. Another thing is of course they’re going to keep tabs on their competition, I’d also be plotting how to make my artist (which I’d already invested millions into training, procedures, promotions, etc.) into being the most well known. Where I draw the line is like them actively pushing rumors and unwarranted hate (especially the Monsta X Wonho case), but the theoretical part is basic business (without the genuine evil actions, monopolization, company racketeering and media control). I even understand the yaoi ranking tracking, like yaoi sells 😭 you’d think haobin would be like as popular as they currently are if they didn’t have the biggest ship to promote each of them last year?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

We're just trying to cope borderline be in denial. I know a lot of people are happy because of how viral this clip went but idk I hate it... Because now, even if it's not Hao or Hanbin's decision, wakeone will see the crazy response and if they smart they're going to continue to capitalize it.
