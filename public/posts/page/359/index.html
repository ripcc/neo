Idgaf about plastic surgery but i just think hanbin lost a bunch of weight which can change one's looks drastically, and hao has always had fuller lips, he's just been overlining them af. Ik overlining the lips became a huge thing in 2024 in korea, aespa's giselle was in soo many videos abt how this "trend" gave her a glowup. Again i really dgaf😭😭 even if they did get plastic surgery i think they look amazing and fans always say the two of them look great irl so i guess props to the surgeons if they were involved</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Let’s be 100% honest, the group just started releasing not that great music, their vocal tones sound like screeching when they try to reach high notes (especially Yeji), and none of them have like super super unique talents. They lost their relevancy and I doubt they’ll ever regain their popularity. If they were any other group under a non-big 4 company no one would be talking about them. And like it’s really odd because the fans they have left swear on their momma the music is good and that it’s all lies, like let’s take a step back and gauge the audience. The music is mid, and even when they were “good” they were copying early Weki Meki. Itzy did fall off. And Ryujin isn’t an actual lesbian and is busy dating annoyying ass Haechan.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Hanbin always knows at least a bit of bnd&amp;riize activities while meongddo ?? they don't even try to know about zb1 at all. If talking about schedule all them are busy af but hanbin really made an effort that none of them even think about, idk maybe I'm just too deep with the idea of zb1 get look down by others

And he always watches their stuff and mentions it to them but not explicitly with him but I feel like zb1 in general just make so much effort to be the nice friendly group of 5th gen and they always get treated like the outcasts. /+r/141688338209001935</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

He’s lucky tho that he lost it all young because while his skin is stretchy he doesn’t have loose skin that most people do who lose a lot of weight later in life because the skin still holds a lot of collagen till around 25 ish then it gets harder to get rid of excess skin /+r/141688356500363319</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
