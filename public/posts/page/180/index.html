Yes I think they are close but I think some of the things (sorry to say but especially hao and specifically on Chinese) is why shippers are getting braver and braver asking invasive questions and blurring the boundaries sort of. It‚Äôs not to blame them because realistically these grown adults shipping them should have the cognitive function to recognise when they are crossing the lines but unfortunately a lot of them don‚Äôt and the more they get fed the more entitled they feel. Whether you believe the ship is real or not is another story but I‚Äôve noticed it more so recently that the crazier the answers they give the more shippers feel comfortable/ justified in asking them worse ones next time especially if they know they will get an answer they want. If they keep
It up then they really are setting themselves up to be followed by it post zb1, and the only way that might die down is if their company doubles down on the not haobin questions or not let them talk about eachother.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
