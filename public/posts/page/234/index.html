Just want to clarify I don’t ship haobin, not bias hanbin or hao but as a large part of the fandom individually and as a duo it’s hard to miss what goes on with them. I 100% agree shippers get more comfortable asking hao stuff because they speak the same language but I’m sorry I can completely coddle this grown man. Half the reason why the questions have gotten as invasive as they have is because he does feed into them and he does give them answers they want and yes sometimes they fish for answers but I’ve seen equally as many repos where he could have given normal answers and chose not too. There’s also the argument that shippers will scold them, I’m sorry to tell you but both these men are going to get scolded anyway, for handing out with other men for not posting with eachother ect. Like at a certain point we have to acknowledge it takes two to tango and it didn’t get this bad on its own. *************** Yes I think the shippers should learn some boundaries and respect too but hao’s 24 and extremely smart he knows what he’s doing too. /+r/160123101693304705</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-03-17 21:51:29</small></header><p>imma have to agree with you its naive to think this manifested purely from one side theres a lot to say on boundaries but thats not the only thing like plz 😭</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>Diff anon I'd just like to add that I noticed how hypocritical shippers are saying "he doesn't look uncomfortable at all so that's okay!" in defense of some crazy invasive questions but they can recognize it's not okay when it's weird questions from gf stans? 😭 Like idk if y'all saw but they started making tweets and threads about that whole whip thing and how it's weird and ngl i chuckled like yeah ofc it's weird!! But why can't y'all say the same about those crazy shippers just because he didn't look annoyed or said shibal to a fan doesn't mean it's okay, and it applies to all kinds of fans idk, also I'm not saying he doesn't go out of his way to say crazy stuff but you really don't want to know the amount of harassment he gets from them if they feel like they don't get enough ship content from him (well because he speaks the same language as them so it's easier to attack him ig) 😭 they used to send him dts in 2023 on bubble and tell him to retire or die if he doesn't do fanservice with hb and post in on the supertopic to brag about it (they're more lowkey now since they started getting hunted by crosins but I'm sure they still do it) like I've been here from the start and I know how insane all kinds of fans can get bruh I could never be an idol /+r/160128297517404787</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I feel like everyone on here knows that but it's still weird for zerocolas to dig for stuff or cross boundaries since he'll tell them what they want to hear even without the leading questions.

As much as I hate it the whole made this thing did catch onto the kside and big food brand were even using it in their advertising (I think it was kfc) so like that really doesn’t mean anything. Also they didnt start following and hb fans till today which is what the rosins picked up on and it wasn’t just hb fans they were literally following anyone. Also when their account first opened their first load of tweets were about someone from monsta x coming back from the military and giving him bibigo? The only time a zb1 member has ever been slightly acknowledged by the account was for the mandu thing and even then they had replied to many other fan accounts before that so really this is a nothing burger. /+r/160126605040246080</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
