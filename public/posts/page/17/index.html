(edited x2) the reason they are leaving hybe is because mhj has no real power over creative decisions and their direction as a group anymore. hybe replaced most of the ador executives with people from BELIFT and HR, people that they know will work for hybe's interests. they literally said it's getting in the way of their work. it's obvious they don't care about newjeans as a group, they see them as one singular product in their line of sublabels and sublabel groups. bsh was even going to put them on hiatus for a year to "get a grammy nominated producer". they even purposefully belittle them to the news reporters, telling them to change the wording and that their sales were less than expected. they let another sublabel copy their branding and target the exact same market newjeans does, and compete against them. the problem at the heart of all this is hybe's unsustainable business practices that allowed them to expand so quickly in 5 years and the parent company cannibalizing a sublabel's group because they want to replace them. they see them as a temporary commodity only. and you're wrong because mhj brought up the album pushing and pressure from the other hybe execs to compete with other groups and be scrutinized by them in these reports from the first press conference. she asked for newjeans to be excluded from these reports and she said she doesn't believe in these business practices. would you really want to be left in the company with these new execs who don't have your best interest in heart over the interest of the parent company (to the point they won't even stick up for you when you're being disrespected by other sublabels staff and actually write articles painting you as a liar to the public) managing the future of your group?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

<small>2024-10-11 21:17:31</small></header><p>she's Canadian??? okay yea she is actually spending thousands I thought maybe she lived in Asia so it would be cheaper.. and doesn't she do fansigns as well? this job can't be regular but exactly can she tell us what she does and what she studied in cuz we're ready to take notes like woah. I can like try to mentally break it down so her flights are definitely the most expensive and if she's not staying over 1-2 weeks accommodation shouldn't be that expensive and the concert fees plus shopping hmmmmm she's probably spending somewhere around $2k USD for every trip but that's not counting fansign stuff Ok that's assuming she's flying from Canada I looked at the tweet again maybe she's a student abroad in korea? So it's cheaper</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#2683</span>
