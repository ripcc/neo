<small>2024-11-05 02:38:51</small></header><p>i dont think so either he was probably just being more reserved for whatever reason friends family yuehua execs like u said but it probably being awk for others still i can see that. but its not a crazy thought like every big shareholder being there is crazy.. like why??? i mentioned seasonal depression or fatigue in another ask overall i dont think its concerning he wasnt totally off or anything</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#671</span>

Anyone in their right mind would want to keep Zb1 who sells millions of albums and can fill arenas. It would be more surprising if they don't try considering that they tried it to Kepler which gave them not even 10% of zb1's revenue. The best that they can do is team up with Thelive or Yuehua. But with how the things are going, they're leaning to Thelive team up which will give us more hope for Hanbin, Matthew, Gunwook and Taerae redebut or continue as zb1 since they got the rights for the name. Yuehuaz will leave and redebut with a new name. Uncle in Yaoi before he goes to military. Although, it would definitely be hard business wise because the top 2 moneymakers are in Yuehua. Wk1's only hope is to build the name of whoever will continue before they disband to expand their fandoms. They still have over a year to do it.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

She's basically taking a break because her relationship with rukidans aren't the best rn since this was the first time Ricky got a lil bit of hate from knets hence why they told her to go back to stanning Jiwoong 😭 Because to Koreans, every Korean knows there's no such thing a pluschat/ bubble ban since the money goes directly to the artist so there's no reason for the company to block it, even if Ricky did get a ban for whatever reason it just sounds absurd to Koreans so they were mad a Balloon for reposting it and getting Ricky his first mini wave of hate because it just sounds so stupid to koreans, like some sort of conspiracy theory fans are making up to shield the artist for their inactivity. Dumbass riyangis think rukidans blame Ricky for not posting, yeah they did in April but then saw him try and saw his effort but he slowly went back to his April days so they accepted him for who he is but riyangis still be counting every single day he doesn't post creating a problem out of nothing. Another misconception is rukidans are not dismissing the pluschat ban either because there could be a slight chance for it to be true but for Balloon, who is Ricky's biggest fan account to post something she's not 100% sure on that led to his first mini hate is why rukidans are pissed at her.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
