I love everything about them like wow I was talking about them today with my friends and almost died LIKE WOW THESE ARE THE FUCKING GOATS PLEASE STAY TOGETHER FOREVER 😭😭😭🩷🩷🩷🩷 Idk what it's like to like the duo from a seokryu point of view but as a gpd Matthew was literally the first person to really extend his hand to gwk when the group formed and took care of him and for that he'll always have a special place in my heart so I just love the dynamic cuz it's so genuine the ship side is even more tea cuz it's freaky yasssssss wow u got me too lit bro come to the good side it's time you eat real food</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/136543390975349928 class=replyLink>/+r/136543390975349928</a>idk if it’s just me but i cannot get into popular duos for the life of me like i used to be a gyubriker then the ship blew up and i muted their names because it just got annoying as fuuuck but i think it was just because of the ones who think ricky’s a girl lmfaoaoao I’m getting there with mattparkz though pls root for meeee sista😭😭😭😭😭 and sorry i know this’ll piss u off but being a taegunv shipper is such a fun experience sometimes like u lowkey have no choice but to treat crumbs like four-course meals and the korean geontaelers thrive even in the deepest pits of poverty like those girls get LITTTT over them standing next to eo in the airport</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Similar faces that look like made in the same mold, mediocre talents praised too highly by their fans, even boring stages on award shows. Mix the members of several groups into one and you won't notice the difference much. While the girls are bunch of beauties with talent and got much better performance</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

His girlfriend is the GOAT she told him to send all his geolocations as he travelled out of Bangkok to bumfuck nowhere, hit the embassies as soon as he disappeared, tagged all his famous actor colleagues in her help-seeking post so they and their fans sent him skyrocketing on hot search and alerting/alarming influential people in the infamous scam areas; flew out to Bangkok to settle affairs and finally got him out.

So PocketDol is now defaming the BAE 173 guy that made it into CYE (legit released a statement today basically accusing him of not being faithful to BAE 173 and not doing his activities, tldr: saying he’s irresponsible and a shitty worker and they also said he wasn’t keeping promises with BAE 173’s fandom) and the other trainee from PocketDol, Kenshin, his dad posted on Instagram a picture of 11:11 (Angel numbers?) captioning it that everyone should pray together that the whole group can debut as one. The Project 7 producers also came out saying that all companies knew (and possibly signed off maybe?) before they sent everyone to the show that no trainee that would win would be allowed to cross promote. Parents are now hopping into the drama and PocketDol has started defaming their own artists. So, to sum it up, we got an abusive company trying to force cross promotion, holding another trainee from the same company that made it in as hostage, several legal questions regarding contract law, a Hitler quote, company defamation towards their own artists, desperate parents, and more 😭</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
