Like there are full grown adults under there (I’m speaking in general) that can and are cosplaying as people that look nothing like themselves and are even hiding their ages. You don’t know if someone you stan has controversies from the past or have done something messed up that would otherwise make you dislike them. It creates this level of protection and inability to hold someone accountable that can be detrimental. And call me superficial but if I’m supporting someone I want to know what they look like, I want to see how they engage in person with other people (are they rude or is their body language hostile in interactions? In that case it’s easier to drop them). I want to put a name to someone’s face and if they are artists I want to see them live at concerts or events. I want to see how they react to things and the way they view the world. I get the VR’s purpose is so it protects their privacy and lets fans project what they actually look like onto them without being disappointed with how they actually look like, but it just seems so, dare I say, idiotic and/or stupid?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-06 23:15:36</small></header><p>They hide their ages their heights it's crazy like they have to fully embody the persona but the reason the appeal is there is because they're not real people look towards the anime and vtuber community the way people can attach and fantasize for those things applies to plave in fact it almost gives an edge to the fantasy since they're operated. You pretty much get how it works but it's just gonna be a case to case thing like I'm similar to you if I'm stanning someone I want to know how they operate in the real world and I'll even dig deep to make it feel rawer? but yea if the whole character fantasy doesn't work for you it'll never make sense I'm kind of in between since I've been into both things but I like something real and tangible way more</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#808</span>

Ricky is a pro at attracting passersby, that's how he gets gazillions of likes and goes viral on douyin and xhs all the time. Passersby love his vibe and face card BUT most of them don't care about him enough to become his fans, and if they do, most of them stan him casually. He has devoted / hardcore fans too, but they're not enough. Hao's fans on the other hand are extremely passionate. There are other fandoms in c-ent that are 100000× bigger than them but crosins managed to put hao in the top 10 of the list of the best selling magazines in 24 hours despite everything. The fact that they did that is huge considering the people on the list are famous artists / A listers so for someone like hao, who at that time had zero promotional activities in china, to be on that list is monumental. His fans are willing to go above and beyond to support him and make him famous which is very rare even for rookies in china. The only other rookies in c-ent who have extremely passionate fans and a ginormous fandom (way, WAY bigger than crosins) are the members of the new boy group from TF entertainment but TF ent is a powerhouse in china and the members participated in a survival-esque show similar to what JYP did with Sixteen to create Twice, so their popularity makes sense. But with the exception of them and hao, I don't think any other rookie (key word: rookie) has devoted and passionate c-fandoms willing to empty their wallets and do whatever it takes to support their favs.
What ricky needs is an influx of obsessive fans, for his obsessive fans / manager fans to become the majority or big enough to control the narrative of the fandom and create an environment that encourages fans to be more loyal and invest in ricky's future. He needs a stronger core fandom.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
