I suddenly felt the urge to 😭 Okay so I finally got around to watch Ricky's Risabae collab right now and seeing all the Korean comments I just AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I fucking hate it. I hate all the anons here that are like wgaf about knets, fuck kgp we got jgp and ifans um helllo?!!!!! WERE A KPOP AKA A KOREAN GROUP MAINLY PROMOTING IN KOREA YOU DIPSHITSSSSS 😭 And fuck all those anons that keep saying give it up knets will never give us the chance but clearly they will just look at all the comments in that collab.... I never seen so many Korean comments full of praises IN AGESSSSSSSSSSS. Moral of my crash out is Knets will give us the chance and it's uncle that's the fucking problem and the fact that ifans refuse to acknowledge how much harm he caused is pissing me off so much I don't think I can ever let what he did to us go..... Why couldn't he just leave the fucking group oh my godddd and I'm sorry I know I know, anons be saying all that mainly out of cope from a situation we cannot change because uncles dick is clearly all up in someones bussy in wakeone, I'm sorry I don't mean fuck yall like that... I'm just sad 😭</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
