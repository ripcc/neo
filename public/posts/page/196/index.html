I feel liek these collabs are a hybe planned they bring on a zb1 member to collab because they know we have the biggest core fanbase and nobody would tune in if there wasn’t a zb1 member, then they give most of lines and center time to their hybe idol to make them stand out when it’s just them leeching off our fame like bnd usually does. Because why did a khia like woonhak have more center time than yujin.

I have been looking into a few aespa videos, and her korean is worse than Ricky and hao(not saying that's bad), and she is a bit introverted. I feel like she still doesn't feel as comfortable around koreans except for the aespa members. And also, I used to be a huge winter stan before looking at their group contents other than performances. But ningning is my favorite now. Also is it okay to say here, I feel like everyone here loves winter, I used to and still think she is the best performer in the group but I don't like her personality at all in some of their group contents.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

MV views? guys, we don't have organic "momentum".😭 Our views are paid for by Wakeone and Allins. Not to mention the innate laziness of our fandom. This is why it's hard to create this illusion that we're doing good because some people won't bother moving.the biggest factor is actually the fact that there's nothing interesting to watch now. they don't add something new. same old boring routine</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
