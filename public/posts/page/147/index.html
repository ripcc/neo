But the problem is that, he really likes being an idol and he didn't establish other career paths growing up aside from idol life. He has nothing to go back to so he needs to succeed. Unless he leaves idol life at 23, goes to the military then goes to college after and be a normal citizen, wasting his talent.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And we know that companies heavily push their idols to do/say some things for pr in zb1 it's very obvious as they're an especially controlled group
-Zb1 have had multiple appearances overseas last year and even earlier this year, but there was a switch that happened in my opinion somewhere this year specifically I think it was partially influenced by the clout zb1 got when they interacted with fans in Japan, partially due to new company strategies
-The shift is with how they present themselves publicly, when the members are overseas they usually have to have staffs around them at all and they usually need to be covered up yet for ex in macau, almost the entire group was just walking in the mall maskless, this is super inconvenient and isn't something that would have happened last year
-I think the easiest example is luckyz because everyone knows they're a very obviously pushed "pr" duo, I thought them hanging out in Japan last time and posting literally all the time was obvious enough (bcs members who organically hang out do not make that much content out of it it would usually be from a schedule), but again today they went out in public completely maskless and "visible clothes" even tho these two arguably have the most ssngs, afaik the only time luckyz have hung out in seoul was during the yhz dinner, it is obvious then esp when you compare the sightings of ggyuvin hanging out alone and hanbin w staffs where they actively make an effort to hide, that they are being massively seen on purpose.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I think it's a 50:50 ratio when it comes to synced groups vs unsynchronized groups. From the big groups: Aespa, IVE, Red Velvet, BP, EXO, GIDLE, NMIXX struggle with synchronization. While other groups like Newjeans, Itzy, TXT, SVT, Twice, Lessersfim are more synchronized groups. And then there's groups that are on the middle ground like Enhypen, SKZ, BTS, etc. On where they are not super synchronized but they don't struggle with synchronization either.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

but if I'm being honest, I don't think wk1 hates them 😭 it's just that whoever manages them is incompetent asf. I do think ricky's lack of socmed presence in their official accounts is weird tho because sometimes the staff will post pictures of every single member but him 😭
but going back to the "wk1 hates yhz" conspiracy, yhz themselves encourage that mentality with the exception of yujin 😭 hao flames and "exposes" wk1 every day, ricky said the company knew he was unhappy and that he wants to be more active on ig and +chat but can't, and gyuvin told a fan who wanted to audition for wk1 to run away and to audition for yuehua instead 😭😭 like, what are their fans supposed to think when their favs say stuff like that?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-24 00:55:20</small></header><p>oh i know why people say this but its more the fact that running to make narratives is just inevitable we talked ab it last week how kpop fans cant be normal about the company their artist is under even if there are valid critiques. like i couldve told you the dayyyyy zb1 were formed exactly how things were gonna turn out people alreayd expected mistreatment for hao and ricky because theyre chinese and the nature of the industry so a couple wrong moves would cement their fate in the eyes of fans and ig cuz theyre 2/4 of yhz the narrative reached over everyone. for ricky its the most valid i guess.. even tho its annoying and still majorly illogical because of his lack of schedules but listing what he said on that fancall is bogus to me CUZ HE DONT OPEN HIS PHONENJFEN thats all him sis. for hao i think its more handling issues but hes not close to poverty in the slightest there can be conversation about how the cpromo efforts arent useful to him since hes a survival show idol but im not chatting to nobody who gets crazy and stupid 😂👋 and dont even get me started on yujin and gyuvin their fans are the most annoying because theyre treated the best for whats its worth AND GYUVIN GOES ON WEEKLY COKE RANTS HIS WORDS DONT MEAN NUN HALF THE TIME!!!!! yujin fans are greedy bastards and gyuvin fans cant be shocked that he was shelved because of his string of microscandals but those 2 have it good wow this just got me irked cuz these people shouldnt have the nerve but they do ugh but ur right if u not a free thinker what else are u supposed to do its whatever cuz i dont care to mingle or talk amongst fans like that</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#6269</span>
