Hao. chin implant
Hanbin. nose job
Taerae. nose job
Gyuvin. eyelids
Matthew. nose job Non invasive (filler/ botox, most to least, still get's them or stopped):
Hao. chin filler + jaw filler. still (you can literally notice when he gets it done because of how his face reacts to it)
Gyuvin. nose bridge and tip filler + masseter botox. still
Taerae. masseter botox + lip fillers. still
Jiwoong. botox everywhere. still
Gunwook. nose tip filler + masseter botox? idk could be weight loss because his masseter isn't hollow like Gyuvin's. still
Ricky. chin filler. stopped, naturally dissolved by now dunno:
Yujin. dunno cause he's still growing so his changes is highly likely puberty unless he suddenly pops up with a pointy ass chin then it's a chin implant or filler but he hasn't so. ps. matthew naturally has a pointy ass chin I know a lot of anons think he got chin filler but nope, ricky naturally has a round sharp chin too but during in bloom days it was extra pointy and long because of the chin filler but you can tell he never got it refilled because it's back to predebut days where his overbite is really noticeable and chin is still sharp but rounder. pss. other changes in members face can be because of weightloss, facial massages etc.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I'm guessing this is the subtext of the less unhinged criticism he's facing from k-fans, but I mean I can't blame i-fans for not picking up on that. Also I didn't type all this as a fan of him, and the people making him out to be a martyr are doing too much in the other direction as always, but yeah considering most people on the i-side especially are only privy to cherry-picked parts of his scandals, it's not surprising to see this convo re-surface and the scolds of both sides righteously ramp up. Also girl don't worry about word-vomiting, I genuinely appreciate it lol. I feel bad inundating people with my paragraphs I can't be brief and succinct for my life.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-15 02:45:17</small></header><p>yea when you consider the fact that he had scandal predebut then apologized more scandal afterward with the ig lives, bad stories, and the threat of exposing more then apologized and went on hiatus CAME BACK apologized and had more exposed. Its not even about the morality of his actions and the response hes a huge liability especially since his group directly benefitted from his hiatus and made feats he wasnt present for so really he shouldnt have been made to come back and all that wouldve been avoided but ifans think the things he got exposed for didnt matter so here we are. And no i didnt think you meant it in his defense lol it was a good discussion piece I like reading what yall gotta say i wish i could be more active so it could be more frequent</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#1360</span>

Not to mention that he really bloats a lot even before being an idol. The important thing is that, whatever face he's wearing, he mogs everyone visually aside from baby Yujin</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
