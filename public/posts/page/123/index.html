Like obviously they back to being trainees so I don’t think some of them will have social media access again. For others it might be different. Like jiwoong will probably reopen his ig and other socials, hanbin’s company have let him have an ig pre debut too so they will let him be active and probably even get him pc or bbl, yuehuaz probably won’t have any socials nor Taerae and then when they debut it will probably just be group socials but I wonder about Matthew and Gunwook. Anyway my guess is that post disbandment and before any of them redebut we will probably only get updates from hb and maybe jw. Possibly gw if he joins thel1ve then he’d get his own socials too.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

They weren’t using Keplers money for shit. This is different because this group has debuted and have consistently been treated better than zb1 despite zb1 pulling in like 95% of wakeones revenue. It’s funny when they try and put Kepler and zb1 on the same level at all when zb1 has been making millions since the first day and clearly we’re not using anyone else’s funds for anything</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Personally I also hate them but at the same time I'm also thankful. Do you know what would happen if my sf don't have these crazies? Gunwook fandom. Always cater to ot9, always protecting ot9 over their own, when someone said they would regret their choice to okay-ing these ot9s over their own they proudly say their bias gonna be proud of them for prioritizing his teammates, now look at where they are and look at what happen to their bias. No job, no line, none of these ot9 who scream about stop sexualizing gunwook, stop protesting about him, stop asking for more just wait patiently, stop making things bigger than they are, other members need us ot9 more than him right now bla bla bla care to spend even some minutes to stream for him or promote him. How can you trust when the result of trusting ot9s is right in front of our eyes?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
