I find it so interesting that haobinists never talk about how hanbin only ever mentions gyuvin when he talks about the member he turns to when he's having a hard time, the one who's always helping him and being there for him, how he's always suggesting other members kiss each other including hao and so much other shit that I won't even get into like damn if they were fr dating that shit is embarrassing asffffff. Tbh us normal stans/ non haobinists really don't care if they're dating or not all the ships are the same to us the only thing that gives these haobinists the nerve or the confidence is because both of them gay and play into that ship fanservice a lot. Ur also no different (even worse) than delusional gf stans or antis/akgaes who say they hate each other the way you keep trying to make it sound like some gospel truth unknown to everyone but yourselves when u get ur "resources" from sasaeng content and misinformation girl PLEEZ ur on the same internet as everyone else and ur a fan just like everyone else u aren't their friend. u sound corny as hell we been in kpop for a while and we know how most kpop popular ships end.
I'd like to see ur reactions fr when they no longer acknowledge each other after disbandment LMAOOO

Truthfully believe what you want and ship who you want! But it’s silly to come here claiming haobin are fs and our tea on them is misinfo. If you’re not a fan of them you’re either obsessed with learning all their inside tea with the intent of proving they’re not real or you don’t know their tea at all and just claim its fake.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

So this is og anon who wrote the post against the troll.
So I wasn’t going to write anything in my post about myungbin and woonghao until I saw anon telling us and requeef to kill ourselves. Looking back at what I said I kept it brief and made sure not to list my reasons of Haobin being real for this exact reason. I never shit on the other ships. I only said I found it funny that anon came here to specifically shit on haobin/their fans and requeef based on two little fs instances. You preach about you being normal but me and other hbinists being “just as bad” as that og anon who told us to kill ourselves yet you felt the need to type a whole coke rant over me simply defending requeef and hbinists. I’m not insecure about haobin being real. Im quite secure in it. What people ship/believe shouldnt matter to others. That wasn’t even the reason for my response to the troll. So something must’ve triggered you for you to immediately get upset with my ask/do the exact thing you claim I did/call haobin only fs/ and bring up hb only mentioning gv when that’s also not true. What bothers you?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And compared to IG that is available to everyone, including Koreans and Koreaboos. So going live in Weibo and speaking Korean is a bit weird. Who are you talking to exactly because even your fans don't understand Korean? It's like going to a Chinese restaurant ordering Korean cuisine & as far as I know, foreigners can't just do live streaming in weibo unless they applied.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
