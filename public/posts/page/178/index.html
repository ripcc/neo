Kimjiwoong is my bias. I get it; you don't, or many other people don't like him. I know he has a weird personality, but the things you have written on this page, like he is lying, doesn't live with members, taking advantage of ricky and others, I can digest, but him sleeping with some staff to get more lines in song, it's difficult for me to digest after reading that. I feel restless. I don't know how to express it, but these thoughts keep moving in my mind 24/7 and I can't take this anymore. I don't know what is right or wrong; maybe I am childish, but I think I start watching him from your pov, and its giving me anxiety üòÖ I just unfollowed all IG and YT accounts of zb1 because it has become difficult to see them now. K-pop is toxic, butttt plz tell me that about him sleeping with someone is rumour ,¬† ofc how do you know, but on what basis you¬† said this? Sorry for the long paragraph, but I think this is my 1st and last group of kpop I hope you will answer this. Thank you.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
