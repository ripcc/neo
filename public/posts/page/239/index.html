matt: idk he’ll prob suffer from the switch up most ppl have on english speaking idols after saying something vaguely controversial/cringe or him being too nice to everyone that talks to him is gonna lead to someone taking advantage of him
taerae: filler addiction/bad ps, shading zb1 members
ricky: drops a clothing line thats super basic but really overpriced and gets called out for scamming fans, tries acting but is super stiff and awkward
gyuv: being nugu is gonna hit him hard and he’ll be going on live for 2-3 hours a day saying stupid shit that gets him in trouble and he’ll be too old for fans to coddle him
gwk: idk hes forever a troll victim but he might get sloppy abt hiding that hes dating
