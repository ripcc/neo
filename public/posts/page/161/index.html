These koreans (not gp) only care about them, and will ignore zb1 even if they give them good songs. I hope wk1 resorts to some sajaegi and does a lot of promo this time.

Bnd, riize, tws and even nct wish are staying within their concept during debut. wk1 probably realized it late in the game so they went back to fresh concept again like ftp & gsb. it was so sad but what can we do? we were not the ones managing zb1. even Jfans seemed to struggle because less people are streaming now or never. They're afraid that sales will be down too. I saw some blaming the song 😭</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

But honestly they're more gossipy simply because zcs and kbnb stalkerish fans are the goats of sharing, I've tried to hit up sooo many solo saesaengs and they're all too batshit insane and unlikeable and usually low-key hate their favs and so it pisses them off when you ask for shit annddd they always want to receive infos with no return 🤦‍♀️ meanwhile the Korean nb fans I've chatted with even the super creepy ones that everyone hate you can still converse with like normal people and they would take the bare minimum exclusive haobin info even if they know way better things and will give me crazy things in return like who the members are dating when it started who's whos ex who's doing that because they don't really care about the other members that much anyways went off on a tangent my bad but fe shout out to the two insane Korean nb fans Ive chatted with I've got some finstas and gf names from them try your luck with one if you have like an unseen sighting or smthg they're nosy af and are the goats of sharing</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
