Bnd, riize, tws and even nct wish are staying within their concept during debut. wk1 probably realized it late in the game so they went back to fresh concept again like ftp & gsb. it was so sad but what can we do? we were not the ones managing zb1. even Jfans seemed to struggle because less people are streaming now or never. They're afraid that sales will be down too. I saw some blaming the song üò≠</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
