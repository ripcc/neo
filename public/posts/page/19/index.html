Then during crush era Wonyoung said his young and rich line too which I think we all agree by now that yes that quote existed before him but she clearly said it because of him because she added the extra 'faboulous jang wonyoung' like his 'charisma boss ricky' at the end. Like this didn't start from schizo tiktokers slow mo ship edits, Wonyoung said the line herself and multiple times so I think ppl just been keeping an eye out whenever something similar happens I mean I would too ðŸ‘€</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Exam period and you sit that exam and if you pass you get a bachelorâ€™s degree. My understanding is that this is completely separate from his DIMA degree because heâ€™s already finished and graduated that. But yeah not just for him but to legally practice as a psychologist in most countries including kr youâ€™d need a masters and then a doctorate if your going into specific roles. Even a counsellor would need a masters. Itâ€™s a good degree to have though, it teaches alot that can be self applied and make you more self aware also idol life aside its a good degree for people who want to go into hr/ marketing / management so I guess you could say itâ€™s a good thing to have / be studying as a leader</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Exam period and you sit that exam and if you pass you get a bachelorâ€™s degree. My understanding is that this is completely separate from his DIMA degree because heâ€™s already finished and graduated that. But yeah not just for him but to legally practice as a psychologist in most countries including kr youâ€™d need a masters and then a doctorate if your going into specific roles. Even a counsellor would need a masters. Itâ€™s a good degree to have though, it teaches alot that can be self applied and make you more self aware also idol life aside its a good degree for people who want to go into hr/ marketing / management so I guess you could say itâ€™s a good thing to have / be studying as a leader</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
