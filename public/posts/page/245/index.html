<small>2025-03-14 17:56:15</small></header><p>have you ever been to uni cuz that is not how it works ðŸ˜­... he cant become a psychologist after taking 1 year of courses he just switched his major to complete a 4 yr degree.

Exam period and you sit that exam and if you pass you get a bachelorâ€™s degree. My understanding is that this is completely separate from his DIMA degree because heâ€™s already finished and graduated that. But yeah not just for him but to legally practice as a psychologist in most countries including kr youâ€™d need a masters and then a doctorate if your going into specific roles. Even a counsellor would need a masters. Itâ€™s a good degree to have though, it teaches alot that can be self applied and make you more self aware also idol life aside its a good degree for people who want to go into hr/ marketing / management so I guess you could say itâ€™s a good thing to have / be studying as a leader /+r/159018412079798929</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
