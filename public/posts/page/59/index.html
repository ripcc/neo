I can see yuehuaz being the most sucessful cause you got zh & yj the top3 members in sk and chn so the album sales might be secure. With rk having okay cfandom and he always attract ifans. While gv he can do things that he currently do. As for hb if he go solo and want to be successful he need to go for acting thats the unspoken rules. I'm not really glazing over ravi he will be discharge mybe after zb1 disbandment and if anything he must be depress as hell cause he need to enlist twice so I dont think he's in his right mind to work on music. If hb will be in a group which is a big possibility cause that p7 guy actually already have a company, they need really good music or concept but after all its probably not it cause they are non big4. I can see mt doesnt know what will he do yet.

Even with the way duhua talked about zb1 including not her own members makes it clear the company knows the value of having a hand in that group and to be completely honest zb1 is more successful with 4 yhz in it that any group yh has ever produced and they themselves know post disbandment no one is guaranteed success. Like anon said it’s a way more stable form of income to keep them in the group even if they negotiate for more management rights ect. There is a members whose company I think definitely won’t resign and that’s based on what I’ve heard here about their actions but each can make their own judgement on who that is because maybe I’m perceiving that differently too. Overall I think the group could continue with less members like the article said but if definitely won’t be with half the yhz gone and it would be fully dependent on who those members are.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
