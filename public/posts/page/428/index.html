For one why are you asking them to plagiarise (Kepler moving to klap) when it’s literally still wakeone staff😭 but also half of the things keplians are cheering about are shit zb1 already got / do. Like xiaoting being able to do more work in China, c line already do that. Going to shows like koms, Taerae already did that. Acting, jiwoong was already allowed to do that (the good bad liar thing. Having a pre release, zb1 had sweat. The only thing we don’t have is personal instas and it makes perfect sense why, changing agency wouldnt change that. While they are under a temporary contract they are working with the idea that they will be going back to their og agencies and most of the boys og agencies won’t want them to have individual social media, not now and not if they redebut into groups till a least a while after. The only reason Kepler got solo instas is because they are staying together and obviously have extended for quite a while to the point their og companies see it more beneficial for them to have instas in the group. I can’t understand zerose like we already have more then Kepler give it a couple months and still see if your begging for them to move under what is essentially wakeone 2.0</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
