It’s not just about his recent live where he talked about going to the Prada event; he’s discussed not drinking several times out of nowhere in the past with nothing, not even comments, asking about it. And like it’s totally chill to hate alcohol but I’m looking at him with a raised eyebrow given the super religious cult rumors about his family and the context that provides. I also look weird at idols who speak too much about drinking too. Idk man. I feel like he has some religious trauma based off the way he interacts, operates, and handles others boundaries. For one of my sociology classes in college, a professional cult researcher gave a talk breaking down the way those raised in super religious upbringings interact with outside perspectives (unusually high defensiveness, failure to understand common boundaries, assumption that others innately believe their beliefs, virtue signaling, a type of boisterous interpersonal connection, etc.) and it’s ringing a few bells with him. It’s one thing to let your religion influence your consumption beliefs, which is pretty normal imo, but this isn’t just that; it’s so much more. I’m super interested to see how he’s going to be in 15 years and if he’ll mellow out more or pull a Siwon from Super Junior and outright talk and promote harsh religious beliefs. Do I think he’s a crazy, evil religious recruiter? Hell no. Am I seeing signs of religious trauma? Absolutely. And I don’t think anyone would argue Gyuvin, especially at debut, acted like a normal idol.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-31 08:27:34</small></header><p>HE ISSSS THATS LIT WHAT HES DOINGGG we were talking about how he doesnt seem practicing and i think hes just take on some beliefs as a cultural thing like for ex i feel like a lot of agnostics that were previously raised in deeply religious households still hold on to values whether its conscious or subconscious so it could be like that for him. Everything just seems like a mix of guilt and like you said some kinda of past event and the cult theory didnt sound wild at all sooooo yea but i can see him mellowing out gyuvins just kinda like that as a person but he tries and he learns</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#2583</span>

And it has private qrts. Can anyone who knows korean tell what this mentally ill bitch is telling him.... I used translator but I couldn't understand anything. Her friend is telling hb that nari is so upset and uncomfortable these days. Also did she also say that he didn't notice because why is hb apologizing. I remember some fans not liking her because of a past fancall where she asked him to get abs comparing him to other idols saying their abs look good in front of his face. The most weird thing is she posted the fancall in weibo saying the other fans will hate her if she posted it in twitter. This bitch is aware that she is mentally ill</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

He's probably tucking when they need to perform. It's actually safer for them to tuck while dancing to protect their prostate.
