Another anon and my two cents omfg I'll never forget that video? or first hand witness of Ricky's chinese sasaeng yelling at him in the middle of the airport 'YOU NEVER LOOK AT ME IM UNSTANNING YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU' and he didn't even give af 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 like bitch why are you even following him in the first place? This was when he missed aaa and he secretly went back to shanghai to renew his passport or something btw so no one knew he went but these bitches had the audacity to yell at him like that across tsa in front of everybody, I can't. Losing these physco sasaengs are a blessing especially earlier on imo since the 'delulu one sided relationship' aint that deep yet.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I'm not sure what arrogance he has that he believes he can survive as an idol without singing. His major fanbases are fleeing, and his engagement is deteriorating day by day. His TWS peers and wishes are being recognized on a regular basis. I never read any nice comments about him on pannchoa English sire when he was discussed. He was once my bias, but not anymore. Frankly, he is becoming a disappointment with each passing day.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I have no doubt the company has some weird restrictions on him in some way but between the pluschat messages and TikTok’s I don’t think that’s them!
