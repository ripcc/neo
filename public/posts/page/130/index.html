I think the levels of their ssngs are close I don't wanna say zb1 fuel anything but compared to riize who don't give reactions to anybody there's less of a gain? so for them to be matched up and imo worse the riize ssngs got it sm is really the reigning champ. also since cssngs tend to be more open and crazed that just leads me to believe kssngs are smarter and more potent? and riize def have more of the latter</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#3863</span>

Plus like gd is signed to a label with Palestinian ties while bighit is up scooter Braun’s ass. They can argue that it isn’t up to the artists YADDA YADDA but at the end of the day supporting big hit groups helps fund Zionist with funding ties to Israel. I’d rather the money go to Palestine.

There’s a contestant named Xinche on it that I cannot stand. He can’t sing, he can’t rap, he can only stiffly dance. The whole thing that gets pushed by the show is that he looks like a doll (also helps he has barely any facial expressions, even when he’s dancing 🙄😒). He’s just a super skinny, highlight wearing, pretty privilege pick. And like of course every survival show is mostly based on looks but it genuinely sucks to see actual talented trainees be constantly sideline for a dude with the personality of celery and the stiffness of a cylinder block. He has rich fans too and is popping off in Asia because he’s a twink anyone can project any identity upon (the perks of not having a personality, am I right?), and like how much money your fans spend is incorporated in scores and ranks so he’s doing really good because of that and is looking like he’ll make the group 😬🤬. The one thing about him I find funny or charming is the fact there are predebut videos of him with his actual ex boyfriend kissing so like there’s undeniable proof and like slay and representation matters but why couldn’t they get an actual talented, out gay man instead 😭. Like fuck, Jesus. Gays are known to be good performers (shoutout Hao, we love you kingy, from one gay to another). Xinche STEP THE FUCK UP. Grrr 😡 🤬</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
