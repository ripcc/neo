I disagree with the sentiment he hates himself for it because he wouldn’t continuously mention that he’s proud of his past (linked to queee spaces) or make comments that allude to being queer but I do think there’s a pressure on him from the industry/ his fans and ultimately manifested into him imposing it on himself that he needs to present a certain way.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Literally everyone, including Koreans, were extremely sympathetic towards him after the strawberry nuisance. I don't even called it an incident; everyone was calling him talented and feeling bad for him. If he had done some fake apology like he was on dieting and felt hungry, so that's why I ate barely 40 calories of strawberry, and he apologized for that. He would have gotten even more empathy and support from non-Zeros.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And tbh if I had people constantly attacking me for shit I didn’t do/ have no control over i probably would have said a lot worse a lot sooner. There are some things that might be viewed as calculated but not in the negative way, I.e purposely shutting down the dating rumours when he did because they were getting really big at that time. It was a good calculated choice for him to call it out when he did rather than ignore it and let it get bigger.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
