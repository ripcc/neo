Cultural difference is a huge factor but like anon said of coarse morally it aint right, asians deserve a childhood too where they enjoy life but it is what it is to get that high grades andin kpop it's that 100% insync rate type of result in a short time.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And the photo was taken on hanbinâ€™s phone so they deffo knew it was him because Matthew has a Samsung. Idk I just think if the company had the foresight to not let them post on bubble the whole day after overlooking that detail seems stupid af but then again this is wakeone. But like anon said at least kfans are being reasonable this time for both hb and gw and realising how insane it is to say they have a political stance over hoodies both have been spotted wearing for weeks beforehand.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Anyway they were mad at that but then clocked it was the same account that said it was a hanbin fan who told Matthew to move at khan and then later confirmed it was actually gyuvin fan but wouldnâ€™t delete the og post. Then people clocked how they post every zb1 duo but Mattbin (so people just clocked that user doesnâ€™t like hanbin) kinda like how mono will post every Gunwook duo but mattparkz ðŸ’€ like it ainâ€™t slick. The whole Matthew debut because of hanbin wasnt anything to do with actual bp but more so if he hadnâ€™t convinced him to join he would have gone back to Canada ect. I guess they used it this time because they mentioned it recently.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

So many western trainees donâ€™t understand/think that they wonâ€™t be held to the same strict standards of normal kpop idols. Intense practice? Making you starve? Forcing you to act like someone you arenâ€™t? Yelling at you to do better? Having you practice with some injuries? Until 2am? Thatâ€™s literally the most fundamental aspects of kpop idol trainee culture. Am I saying itâ€™s morally right? No. Itâ€™s clearly fucked up and detrimental and does so much damage. But itâ€™s the real world westerners get into when they want to debut with these kpop companyâ€™s, and some of them are ignorant or think that theyâ€™ll be treated differently because they arenâ€™t a kpop group. What do they think being an idol is like? Why do you think these companies got so successful to begin with and have such skilled idols? And obviously the company isnâ€™t going to let you produce and release songs the second you debut, what sense would that make? What if your music isnâ€™t good or straight up goes against their artistic strategy to grow your career?? Look, Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s good. I just find it stupid that the western idol wannabes or their parents walk into a lionâ€™s cage and get shocked when, wow, they get bitten. It just reminds me of what Manon said of how she started the Kasteye program thing and didnâ€™t realize the workload was so much but was forced to do better and she did. But, obviously, there are insane limits too. The VCHA girls saying there were hidden cameras in their dorm and in their pantry to track how much they ate - JYPE (to our knowledge) doesnâ€™t even do that shit with their kpop groups. And downplaying suicide attempt is sick af. Itâ€™s just that I wish that western (typically non-Asian) trainees wouldnâ€™t be so ignorant/ surprised about the system - that way they also donâ€™t get so surprised when subjected to it.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
