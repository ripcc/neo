While things have changed since swing stepped in its still wakeone and kepler were apparently being comanaged by swing from the start so that already tells us changes arent that big and probably cater to zb1 more.

Here with Taerae : https://x.com/traelxve/status/1850856805196546225?t=lrT821t-VsIW-VXDip68rg&amp;s=19 Here with Gunwook it looks very natural tbh. https://x.com/ay_lafyuu/status/1853212803341197475?t=xGGGyCbVoKO0uehZY2ge1A&amp;s=19 https://x.com/yujin_ke/status/1853417783184478559?t=xyw3cqBXuZ4CHwmm6Zsozg&amp;s=19 Here with ricky : https://x.com/yuehuazip/status/1853389151804010663?t=0Fm28mYS87VktsA8gVLA3g&amp;s=19 You can skip the link but my point here is He is more natural with taerae and gunwook, ricky and Matthew too, I find yujin is just doing fanservice with hao because it doesn't come out to be very natural.
