Apparently it’s not about the lack of male trainees, like yes there is a decline but if 3 males survival shows running at the same time and all gather hundreds of trainees there’s no way bp2 wouldn’t especially with seeing the success of zb1.
But like anon said they apparently are being super strict with who they take in which is why they don’t have enough trainees yet tho I feel like they will take a lot from the survivals shows who just finished and made it to the finals but not debut</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
