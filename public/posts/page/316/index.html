Like literally anyone with eyes can see it happened it was a huge topic of discussion like every 2 months amongst kfans because no one understood it like it's very clear and purposeful marketing ik most of your anons are rosins obsessed with haobin but to deny the ban happened is crazy+the pc thing is suchh rosin propaganda I've seen a lot of visibly edited ones being spread 😭😭and that's not to say some zcs aren't evil but please check the numbers of people that identify as zc and the number of people that identify as rosins you will see who definitely has more power especially given that rosins used to openly cuss out Hao on his SUPERTOPIC for interacting with Hanbin and harassed him so bad for going to jeju he had to address and they made edits that it was zcs for some reason being mad when everyone was cheering? Do intl fans actually think zcs have this much power???
Sorry but Hao isn't forced to do what he does, the things he did after the massive freak out in April, him liking an account named binhao get married, wearing a b❤️h fan gifted ring and showing it off at the airport and on pc like an engagement ring, going back to his home for the first time wearing a full Hanbin/Haobin related fit, wearing the necklace hanbin gifted him on qixi... literally no zc demand or expect Hao to do that, like literally not a single one because no other male celebrities even in straight cps does these are things he did out of his own volition 😭 Man sorry this is just so frustrating I'm one of your og anon from cc who never has talked about haobin before but as a mandarin speaker and a haobin biased fan it's so frustrating seeing people here alwayyyys lying on their name while not even speaking Chinese or knowing the most basic things about haobin</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
