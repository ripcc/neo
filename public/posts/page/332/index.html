Mostly with international fans and the constant boycotting. Like, they must feel like they wasted Wonbin and Sungchan and Anton in the group, the rest of them are forgettable but like Sungchan has an insane amount of gf stans, Anton's a nepo baby with a super handsome face, and Wonbin has such an amazing face (even if you personally disagree, I (and most people) are gagged the first time they see him before he talks, plus his face fits so many korean beauty standards so some people ignore the fact he's short). I wonder where the group would stand internationally had they never debuted Seunghan to begin with and never had such a big scandal. They also revealed some new SM male trainees recently and I've been seeing some old-RIIZE twitter users change their profile pics to the trainees and already move on. The kpop cycle is so brutal akdljflakdj</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

It made me wonder since they definitely don’t seem as close as before, what happened? Were they close because of convenience or something?

Also I feel like when there werent clear friendships in the group yet it was easy for them to be closer but they don't live in the same apartment even so I get it but about the photos that's probably cuz of haos broken phone with lost pics</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#10252</span>

The allins getting mad at this are such hypocrites. They can hate on other zb1 members while liking any other man, but zeroses can't hate on other groups.They can like bnd as much as they want but they can't expect the same from others when even knetz have noticed this group being weird with zb1. And it is not a flex to say bnd only likes hanbin when these men are also probably not so nice behind hb's back (especially when you remember the hybe report where they called zb1 synergy of ugliness)</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I do have to laugh tho because why did they have 100 people in that gc and think it was never going to be blasted 😭. These people will jump on jh/bnd just as quick if any of them say anything about hb but they haven’t till this point which is probably why they don’t bother although I don’t think it will stay that way after this so who knows maybe they will start fighting onedoors soon too. /+r/144476214449626827</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
