K-Soul, that one Chinese trainee that made it to the group but no one knows his true age. He’s been on several survival shows in China and Korea and I think he tried a Japanese one but I’m not sure, either way he wrote down different years on different shows so no one knows if he was born from 1996-2002, odds are 1997 or 1998 but 🤷‍♀️. He also accused one of the trainers of the show of being racist because he wasn’t given a part he wanted (keep in mind he’s not a rapper, it was a rapping part, he was already center AND he already had the most amount of lines and was trying to take the only lines the other guy had). He’s made fatphobic comments several times to some of his future members during the show, talk backed to the mentors several times to the point that Soyeon snickered when he was announced in the group, wore twists, and made some uncomfortable sexual jokes with one of the Maknaes (he was 13/14 years old btw, he was born in 2009 to put it into context😭). And he shades/makes mean comments for the sake of “joking” but really they’re coming at the expense of others. It’s just an all around mess.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
