From the kgpd thing I don’t think anyone had an issue with gw in the first place like k side and I side no one was saying anything (neg) about him but that one gpd burner randomly jumped on hb so they retaliated with their own burners.

It's not that they're doing badly because they're rookies, but it's like they were dragged out of a public place against their will. I was looking forward to seeing the members for the first time in a long time, but I was embarrassed the whole time. I think from next time, only the members who want to appear should appear” and then a kgpd qrt then mentioning hanbin and then it just tunred into burner accounts going back and forth and dying off into personal insults. Tbh I’m still not sure what the issue actually was, no one on the I side said anything even the akgaes so I guess it’s died over there now. /+r/140869963996157005</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
