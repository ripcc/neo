For hanbins finsta there was a rumor that he posted a photo that was taken on Haos phone. For the main part of my ask it was talking about Haos wc predebut and after he got close to Hanbin. He had a blank pfp and was seemingly a bit aloof with people but after getting close to Hanbin he kept changing his pfp to different cute/baby pics of hb including hbs fav Pokémon. And being all cute and sappy/having cute arguments with Hanbin. And then said “真正意义上的初恋” (true first love/love in the truest form) about Hanbin soon after. Hao posted moments on WeChat for only his friends and family to see about Hanbin and 2 that I cannot share myself. To the akgae solos who hate them, hao also apparently cussed yall out and protected Hanbin. In china, doing such things is never done by friends and is even rare in relationships. Doing so classifies you as a “love brain” (obsessed with love/your partner) the wc lore goes deep so I’ll stop here lmao… but there’s just too much lore on them I can’t keep up /+r/139035719443370511</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

All I’ll say because requeef doesn’t like Haobin talk much, is the pfp to Hanbin multiple times after it being blank through college (seeing said pics myself and hao confirmed during a mass crash out between their solos… bruh it was crazy) and then calling Hanbin his true first love (came from same op who said the pfp rumor.) there’s tons of other things that I can’t talk about… but that in itself is very clear there’s at least romantic feelings involved. I’ve seen/heard lots of akgaes trying to start something about them with other people or bring up their past but it’s always been proven wrong/unreliable. They’re just mad straight girls who don’t have a chance with their bias. /+r/138859604431034176</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
