And fan scrutiny toward them is inevitable, it's just part of the fandom/entertainment ecosystem. But to outright condone the "hyper scrutiny" of idols bc they got big money (only 5% get it from their careers) and are worshipped by fans (most of which is transactional and controlling in nature) is not only incredibly perverse and frankly vengeful, but also fucking dumb bc hyper scrutiny and paranoid near-constant surveillance directly worsens their collective quality. It's just so bizarre to want and expect idol-aspiring teens to have the forethought and wherewithal to resist the temptation of forbidden romance and casual flings/hookups, a temptation that is literally artificially CREATED by the sexually repressive idol training environment itself. They dont all just come in with it. And the idea that giving in and getting caught indicates they aren't serious about their career is just so dumb and unempathetic I have to imagine it's coming from people who raise their hands in class to remind the teacher there was homework or otherwise have such intense aversion to sex that they cannot conceive of normal sexual drives in young adults (assumedly their peers. please tell me these arent the thoughts of people 21+). I mean the only reason this unofficial rule is even imposed and discussed within kpop is bc most kpop fans are control freaks, tattletales, simple-minded misanthropes, or low libidinal escapists, too many of whom genuinely think giving up romantic/social life for the sake of a career is a mature sign of dedication, pragmatism, and passion for work rather than a cope for their inability to multitask, social ineptitude, fear of intimacy, or lack of passion for/direction in life beyond work.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Whether theyre wrong or not doesnt really matter since it still happens and thats the way of the industry. hfjkdkijghfkdsk it was too early for me to really lay down my opinion and dissect what i agreed with and disgreed with but I do generally believe that regular human things are gonna be villainized and because its so widely known theres a caution those entering should have. And I really meant this in the crazier scenarios just because an idol hasnt been exposed doesnt mean theyve dated and drank and smoked and just behaved like a teenager but imo with seunghan it was a lot worse than just that a lot of people try to chalk it up that way but everything that id seen about him and even eunseok soured them a bit but i dont hate them. og anons ask was harsh but i was thinking of seunghan and the recent male idol exposés</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#1859</span>

He was also rank 2 on the show, and since rank 1 left and sued the company, you can argue Gyurae is their PO1.
