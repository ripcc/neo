Also side note not talking shit about his friendships being a point is so crazy dhejekleo especially when soo many of his "close friends" talk shit about him, sell his infos and even helped spread a lot of his past infos that got him outed like yeah they're shit people sorry 😭😭or are they talking about people saying luckyz is fake and pushed? Something that the vast majority of crosins know and hate lmao are we not allowed to talk about it because little things like that break the narrative that Hao isn't pushed or that Hao would never do that? Like it's not even negative it's just obvious ALSO very funny considering rosins literally harass haos friends in zb1 all the time like Hao constantly promote the group and praises the group he doesn't gaf nor talk about his other friends and y'all don't care so get this lame ass parasocialism out of here</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

If you receive anons that are speaking negatively about him, reply to them to defend him. This includes topics surrounding wndgs as well. Stop talking negatively about them. That's it.

Their only contribution in Kpop is Twitter trending, voting and toxicity in the fandom. I'm speaking as a Rosin. Those Indonesian Rosins only know how to start SF wars and they're giving Rosins a bad rep. But they don't contribute in sales. They aren't even guilty that they're giving Hao a bad pr but couldn't even buy a magazine. I'm checking their GOs and they don't even reach 100. But they can start an SF war everyday. So yeah. Indonesians have no buying power. In SEA countries, Thais have the good balance of buying and streaming power.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

If it’s something like a magazine these things are usually planned in advance and the lack of response would have had them taking back the offer after getting ghosted for so long. Whatever it was they clearly wanted to work with him. Also imo it makes more sense for them to post on twt rather than Weibo, they are trying to get wakeone to respond to emails so you think twt or Weibo is going to be more effecting in getting their attention?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
