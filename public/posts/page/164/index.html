Ricky is a pro at attracting passersby, that's how he gets gazillions of likes and goes viral on douyin and xhs all the time. Passersby love his vibe and face card BUT most of them don't care about him enough to become his fans, and if they do, most of them stan him casually. He has devoted / hardcore fans too, but they're not enough. Hao's fans on the other hand are extremely passionate. There are other fandoms in c-ent that are 100000× bigger than them but crosins managed to put hao in the top 10 of the list of the best selling magazines in 24 hours despite everything. The fact that they did that is huge considering the people on the list are famous artists / A listers so for someone like hao, who at that time had zero promotional activities in china, to be on that list is monumental. His fans are willing to go above and beyond to support him and make him famous which is very rare even for rookies in china. The only other rookies in c-ent who have extremely passionate fans and a ginormous fandom (way, WAY bigger than crosins) are the members of the new boy group from TF entertainment but TF ent is a powerhouse in china and the members participated in a survival-esque show similar to what JYP did with Sixteen to create Twice, so their popularity makes sense. But with the exception of them and hao, I don't think any other rookie (key word: rookie) has devoted and passionate c-fandoms willing to empty their wallets and do whatever it takes to support their favs.
What ricky needs is an influx of obsessive fans, for his obsessive fans / manager fans to become the majority or big enough to control the narrative of the fandom and create an environment that encourages fans to be more loyal and invest in ricky's future. He needs a stronger core fandom.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Somebody get her ass on fallon. And all those interviews are abt her exbf and changing the idol industry by writing her own songs and like nobody outside the kpop sphere is going to care. Ur average person doesn't even know that idols aren't allowed to date and their only interaction with kpop is dynamite /+r/6b8c8af34c</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

This isn't normal at all, especially for a company report; It's not just some texts or something from a group chat where it's maybe ok to be less professional. It's one thing to analyze the competition and note strengths and weaknesses, but another to outright slander other groups and make weird comments about minors.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I'm still surprised he didnt come at all since day 2 concert cuz he has to know what has happened so I seriously think ricky is trying to tell those pchat ban believers to stop by not coming at all and c'mon lets be real he only came day 2 concert cuz gyuvin told him fans were worried about his thumb since they were asking about it on gyuvins own pchat and gyuvin had to reassure ricky was fine himself and then ricky came right after. like theyre saying ricky isnt coming now cuz he got in trouble for that fancall but then what about the entire 2 weeks of gsb promos, why didn't he come then? what trouble was he in back then for him not to come for 2 weeks? like they seriously just need to accept he doesn't come and its completely okay i mean it sucks too cuz u want to see ur fav everyday and get to know them more on a personal level but at the same time ur stanning ricky someone who values privacy and likes being alone..... idk mayb stan someone else atp then cuz ur gonna be counting when hes not posting even after zb1 lbfr like what happens then? is it yuehuas fault?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
