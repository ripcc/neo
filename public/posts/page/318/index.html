What I realised from wb fights is that rosins are all bark no bites they create all these issues for Hao (these posts has hundreds of thousands of likes and it was number 1 trending topic all day) but they can't defend him or fight for shit this is the second time 8stars absolutely rip into Hao while the only thing they can say is that he's ugly these women actually have rocks for brains if their goal is for Hao to one day be a top star in cent it's quite literally never happening with things like this happening every two days and them not being able to defend him or hold any kind of accountability for their fandom for now their behaviour only affects Hao but if it keeps it will one day affect the group ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI was so pissed at them yesterday</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Woodz can sing and rap but his dancing is just good but isn‚Äôt as great as gunwook‚Äôs. Soyeon isn‚Äôt that good of a dancer despite her rapping being great and singing good. J-Hope can rap and dance but can‚Äôt sing that good. Maybe Hoshi? But his rapping isn‚Äôt that strong. One of the nmixx girls maybe? I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I might be a little too delusional tho. If anyone says sung hanbin or seok Matthew I‚Äôd swing though. Hanbin can‚Äôt rap (plus his voice is too airy and soft to be convincingly intimidating - remember his AOTM song?). Matthew can‚Äôt rap as good as Gunwook either. Don‚Äôt get me started on Jiwoong.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Sure the realistic odds is that they might not be as big as zb1 is but I‚Äôd take him getting more lines, variety appearances, and industry connections over a mama award anyday. His vocals have been getting increasingly better and I need a solo track from him eventually. ZB1 would never let him do that or prioritize him enough. Plus he‚Äôs the only member in the group (and one of the only idols in all of kpop) that could actually handle dancing, rapping, and singing all in a solo, plus he could very well write his own stuff. (Hanbin solos argue with a wall if you think his rapping was even close to being good and if his pen game is even a tenth of Gunwook‚Äôs). Gunwook has so much potential and the company has pushed that away in order to profit off of the more well known trainees when they debuted (which I get from a short term project but still). It‚Äôs their loss for not investing and realizing how much talent gunwook has and what an amazing tone he can work with. Plus he‚Äôs smart, and even if he did ever become nugu nugu I‚Äôm confident he‚Äôd think of something to get more attention. I sincerely feel it in my soul he could strategize ways to keep relevant and promote his future group. Plus with a little more promotion all the ahjummas would love him and he could gain some of the lim young woong voting bloc.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Not just weight gain - he for sure had something done. I don‚Äôt like him because his vibes are ick, not in like a creepy way but in an overly emotional, dramatic and bitchy way. Chenle also gives judgy. Yk fuck it fuck like all of nct. Johnny can‚Äôt sing or rap, Yuta‚Äôs filler makes ricky looks natural. Mark serves absolute nerdy sleazy vibes (his is forgivable but just a bit cringe). Jaemin has sinister energy but at least his body is insane. Jeno for sure has several hoes even if he has half of a personality. Jaehyun said a slur but everyone already knows that. Haechann seems gross. Hendery too underrated but I ain‚Äôt forget him and Kun wearing those fuckass dreads. Ten gives outdated millennial who doesn‚Äôt think deep enough. Sion too busy playing with his dick during livestreams to be professional. Doyoung‚Ä¶.. Taeyong‚Ä¶. Eh I give up fuck Lucas and death to taeil. And xiaojun you‚Äôre cool or whateve plus shout-out to your dad for being a drag queen. Idc ‚Äòbout the rest but like sakuya you chill and get a pass for being Yujin‚Äôs age.
