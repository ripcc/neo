Step back and devil game are also so good and kinda funky, someone said devil game reminds them of exo lucky one and I can kinda see it, blue was nice but can’t really tell since it’s the same snippet….ngl I don’t think I really understand cruel, like it feels like it’s a bit rock but also probably the most experimental out of all the tracks so feel like I’d have to listen to the full song to get it. What’s ur ranking right now?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-02-21 17:05:23</small></header><p>OMG LUCKY ONE YESSSS THATS WHAT DEVIL GAME REMINDS ME OFFFF this is so crazy I was looping that song all summer hoping that's what gsb would sound like 😭 but wow they would've hit daebak if they came back with out of love instead of ftp 💔 I was so sure of step back being hip hop but it's so good and I love the funk UGH THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED. Blue has grown on me but I can't shake the feeling of it not being a strong enough title but we move.. cruel is pop rock like I expected but someone already mentioned none of the songs hit the 3 minute mark except for blue soooo idk how these r gonna sound 😅 And I'd rank it like this probably Devils game Step back Out of love Blue DrDr Cruel</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#11355</span>
