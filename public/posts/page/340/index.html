It's not a racist thing, it's just the easiest way to describe to someone how someone looks and it's rarer for asians to have 'Arab' faces but not impossible. Lee Dongwook is a classic 'Arab' face to Koreans and when you look at Ricky he's pretty similar, like they don't look a like but they both have an 'Arab' face. /+r/143455476968020069</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
