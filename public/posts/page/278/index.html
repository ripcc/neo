I get that there is a bigger barrier to entry for the kind of shows he would thrive in but its just such a waste of him to be relegated to these fluffy (no pun intended) concept-less interviews, like it almost feels demeaning atp, and i hope he doesnt get discouraged bc he makes everything enjoyable through sheer will anyway and his passion and aptitudes all in one person are one in a million and i'll just keep saying it 😠😪</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
