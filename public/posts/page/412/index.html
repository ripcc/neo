<small>2024-12-25 20:50:14</small></header><p>okay I'll just say eeeeverything I got the tix off global interpark with a shuttle package so I got up early to take THE 10 AM SHUTTLE UGHHH I WANTED TO DIE but basically inspire arena is inside a humungous mall so there's shit to do while waiting. It was actually pretty calm till around 1pm that's when most people came and I don't think I've ever been somewhere that packed because it's also a very popular mall so you can imagine 15k people plus regular mall goers I was getting overstimulated. But checking in and getting seated was really easy and quick my view was soooo gaggy and it took so long to start ugh Now onto the performances First was Lee youngji she's actually a good performer and she can sangggg Izna.. we might have to stop the hate they're rlly pretty and great performers Baemon was lame as fuck DONT PERFORM SHIT SONGS. Ahyeon doesn't stand out in the slightest chiquita and asa were ending her the high note was booboo Illit were dancing to nursery rhyme beats and dressed in infant clothing it was weird üò≠ but I get why the group is centered around wonhee the rest of them aren't shit UGH SORRY TO FALL VICTIM BUT I LOVEDDDDD NCT WISH STEADY and lowkey been keeping an eye on them the little dance break was cute and tbh only 2 of them stick out it's sion and sakuya but the song was rlly fun and I listen to it Riize were riize it didn't feel too special and I would've preferred their other songs like love119... really??? It was boring till the end wonbin was right in front of me and he was so cute but that's rlly it like damn that was regular asf poond was shit on a plate and I wasn't even trying to be a hater like they actually cannot perform or dance or sing üò≠... the girl next to me was a poond fan had a lightstivk and all and didn't even record or turn it on idk if they were paying ppl but it was a booty stage Zbwon... my heart was beating sooo fast but they performed at the stage I couldn't see at AND THEY CAME TO THE MIDDLE TO PERFORM THE OTHER WAY I WAS SOOOOO FRICKING SAD üò≠üíî they turned around for the last chorus and to make matters worse.. gwks stage was also at the stage I couldn't see omg I wanted to cry but they're actually so cute and perfect and fun they got good cheers but the people around me were saying they could tell they love being on the stage ayeeee New jeans only for screams in the beginning the first part was boring but it picked up and they're sooo fricking cute and pretty and hanni and Danielle kept interacting with my section wow I rlly have to fuck with these queens forever I laughed at yunjins intro for lsfm they're trying too hard with the concept üò≠ omg I had to let the eunchae hate go guys... SHES PRETTY IRL NOOOO AND HE FIGURE IS SOOOO NICE chaewon is extremely skinny tho i was like woah but damn kazuha wasn't cute i was surprised Nmixx was a little gaggy but wow BAE IS BEAUTIFUL SORRY FOR HATING SIS their songs were different and fun to see I feel like sullyoon is beautiful but she looks the same if that makes sense Maknae stage was yujin cityy Ives set was extremely boring but annyeongz gagged I wish they did more Treasure are good performers but this was lame... asahi is so cute tho IT WAS DEAD SILENT FOR ATEEZ AND SKZ üò≠üò≠üò≠ ENHYPEN WERE ACTUALLY GOATED ASF THEIR STAGE WAS SO WELL PUT TGTHR AND FUN AND NIKI AND JAKE AND JUNGWOJ ARE BEAUTIFUL sunghoon doesn't look better irl tho... hes no longer my king i gotta freak niki and Jake now i was on my phone for half of the stuff esp key txt gidle ugh HFJFJDJDJDNDN GGUM WAS LIT ASF WE MIGHT HAVE TO GIVE YEONJUJ HIS 3s Aespa performed a bside we never heard of... and did supernova the other way üòë karina is crazy gorg tho everyone's pretty but Giselle lolll 2ne1 had me jumping everyone went insane it was everythinggg like I lost my mind Nct was lit af icllll LIKE THEYRE STILL THE GOATS AND TRIPLE J ARE HANDSOME AS FUCKKKKK OMG I NEED JENOS PUM TONIGHTTTT And gd WAS FUCKING TERRIBLE Cravity minhee is so gorg omggg</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>why you always like dozens? #wonheepilled #mjxpilled /+r/130778675254875145</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
