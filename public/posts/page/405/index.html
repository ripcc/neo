Nationality and Outing: His nationality and being outed are weaponized against him or fetishized by the fandom. Frustration with Fandom Narratives False Equivalence: The fandom portrays Zhang Hao’s struggles as similar to others’, ignoring the unique and disproportionate challenges he faces. This false equivalence undermines the severity of the issues he endures. Villainization of Rosins: Rosins are villainized for addressing these issues and accused of not caring about others. Their concerns are dismissed as obsessive or toxic instead of being taken seriously. Harmful Behavior in the Community Fetishization: Zhang Hao’s struggles are fetishized, not empathized with, turning his challenges into a spectacle rather than a call for support. Invasive Actions: The community supports or tolerates invasive behavior toward Zhang Hao while failing to reflect on how harmful and dismissive this is. Deflection and Justification: Instead of addressing their actions, the community justifies their behavior by labeling Rosins as “akgaes” (obsessive solo stans), which dismisses the legitimacy of their concerns. Double Standards Rosins vs. Allins: There is a clear double standard in how issues raised by Rosins and Allins are treated.
Concerns raised by Rosins hold more validity, as they address systemic bias and real harm, yet they are consistently undermined.

The driver license pic of him idk 16? in LA to 20 is also a good comparison because everything is the same. People need to hop of his dick 😭 because the plastic surgery agenda with him is so forced if you actually look at his predebut stuff and screams insecurity.

There will always be rosins (and allins) who feel their bias is bearing the brunt or the lesser side of the ship and that will never change. And depending on who your bias is I can promise you you will quite literally never ever care to see the other perspective and will always feel your bias is the one people don’t care about when in honest fact haobin is probably one of the first kpop ships in which I can say there is a pretty even spread in which person of that ship is the number 1 bias. Also I’m not sure why your talking to me like I’m a haobinist because I’m not and quite literally anyone whose been in kpop for a while and has a fully developed frontal lobe can tell you this is how it’s been and how it will always be and isn’t unique to this situation. You care for your bias and he’s your bias so obviously anything that negatively effects him is going to be viewed and felt more intensely than similar things happening to other members / other part of the ship but it doesn’t dismiss that it does happen to both party and in diffrent ways and just because you don’t want to acknowledge that doesn’t mean it’s not going to happen. /+r/135812093596357405</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Nationality and Outing: His nationality and being outed are weaponized against him or fetishized by the fandom. Frustration with Fandom Narratives False Equivalence: The fandom portrays Zhang Hao’s struggles as similar to others’, ignoring the unique and disproportionate challenges he faces. This false equivalence undermines the severity of the issues he endures. Villainization of Rosins: Rosins are villainized for addressing these issues and accused of not caring about others. Their concerns are dismissed as obsessive or toxic instead of being taken seriously. Harmful Behavior in the Community Fetishization: Zhang Hao’s struggles are fetishized, not empathized with, turning his challenges into a spectacle rather than a call for support. Invasive Actions: The community supports or tolerates invasive behavior toward Zhang Hao while failing to reflect on how harmful and dismissive this is. Deflection and Justification: Instead of addressing their actions, the community justifies their behavior by labeling Rosins as “akgaes” (obsessive solo stans), which dismisses the legitimacy of their concerns. Double Standards Rosins vs. Allins: There is a clear double standard in how issues raised by Rosins and Allins are treated.
Concerns raised by Rosins hold more validity, as they address systemic bias and real harm, yet they are consistently undermined. Call-Out to Specific Individuals Requeefiem’s Role: You accuse Requeefiem of validating and encouraging problematic community behavior due to their personal biases. Request for Requeefiem to stop supporting harmful actions if they don’t understand the issues fully. Would you like to elaborate on any specific points or adjust the tone?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

In our case the unique thing is once they disband it will become really clear whose peoples number 1 was because that’s ultimately the one they will keep up with more. Until then there will always be rosins saying haobinist don’t care about hao and allins saying haobinist don’t care about hanbin. Fact of the matter is only a few will truly care about both equally and some will care more for hao and some more for hanbin and they can’t control or change that or even get them to drop the ship to focus on their fave like they want because that’s not and never been how shipping works. /+r/135785348893726748</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
