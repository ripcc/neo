Not sure about the whole fiasco but it's about Hao having control on ZB1 accounts in Chinese platforms that's why Ricky couldn't post. CRosins think that Hao saw it, the reason why he jad to clarify in his plus chat that the staff asked him for a caption to tell people that he's not the one managing the sns. This is just funny. If you translate this absurdity to international platforms, we will get Hanbin managing them so Ricky couldn't post. ðŸ¤£</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

He was also rank 2 on the show, and since rank 1 left and sued the company, you can argue Gyurae is their PO1.

I've seen some Japanese accounts showing proofs that they voted for Taerae just so they can speak up about the FBs doing all the promos for Taerae's which they didn't do for Hao's and ZB1 marketing reason is that they didn't do individual voting before to avoid SF war because another member was nominated when Hao was the only one nominated that time. And Zeroseville not talking about this and call out the FBs is just promoting the narrative that Zeroses don't care about Hao the way they do with other members.

There really hasnâ€™t been any update if his dad (it was his father that was sick I believe) has gotten better or not, but since then K-Soul has been on a hiatus for over 5 months and is promoting his solo album (his contract with Fantasy Boys label (PocketDol) allows him to has his own solo album even if it isnâ€™t through them so he isnâ€™t breaking any laws by doing so). His solo isnâ€™t tied to any other big label but rather a small group of people. Odds are he wonâ€™t return to Fantasy Boys since lord remembers the last time he was promoted on fantasy boys official and they havenâ€™t had a comeback in forever. The group is sending some of their members to another survival show either way coming up. Initially Fantasy Boys had a somewhat okay following even tho the show was horrendous (Iâ€™ve watched over 20 survival shows and it was the worst Iâ€™ve ever seen) because it aired on public cable, so it actually had higher ratings than Boys Planet. But Iâ€™d say 1/3rd of those that followed the show, even if their faves got in, stopped and quit the group because K Soul got in and because the ranking system made no sense. Also, itâ€™s one thing if he was talented and had his personality, like if he was Adele i feel like most people could ignore how he acts, but his singing is mediocre, he canâ€™t rap, his dance is ok but he canâ€™t make expressions, I think heâ€™s had too much work + botox done. He also hasnâ€™t once released a childhood photo despite the rest of his members doing so, and I believe itâ€™s because someone would research it and find out how old he is and see what work heâ€™s had done. For those that think Iâ€™m tripping, look up one of his fancams and look at how he moves his face. Itâ€™s somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

But fr, hao's case is interesting, I feel like he wants to pander to all the types of fans he has but he's also cautious with ssgns because he knows they're on another level of craziness. Blank and her info will forever be missed.
"Hao is jesus to them, he is good enough to his ssfans that they don't talk bad about him but he's not close to them either, simply ignore them or wave his hand, politely refuse when they come near and that's the perfect way to communicate with ssfan."
"Hao also acknowledges them whenever and whereever but ricky ignores them if they aint supposed to be there"
"for the most part it's true how hao is nice to ssgs all the time but ricky is 'selective' but it goes deep like back in bp"
"Ricky, if he's in a public place or on a schedule, he'll interact, otherwise he'll ignore you or glaring at the camera. He rarely goes out and one time they followed him while he was walking or something like that in the middle of the night so he looked straight at the camera and asked them what they were doing, not even looking at them which made them so f mad lol"
Maybe hao has experience from when he was in uni lmao, sorry I just remembered this fucking video (the first clip)<blockquote class=twitter-tweet><a href=https://twitter.com/haoesome/status/1639901626025771008></a></blockquote>poor guy had stalkers even before he debuted. But I respect ricky's way of dealing with those crazies, like sure, he lost fans for ignoring them, but is it really a loss if the fans in question are ssngs?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

<small>2024-09-30 00:26:37</small></header><p>jiwoong- don't pay attention
hao- mix of eye contact or straight up ignoring
hanbin- he has more of a resting cute face? Ik that's not has natural face but he holds that also ngl I don't watch his vids much
taerae- I've probably seen like 5 taerae vids max but you can really tell what he's thinking on his face matthew- ngl if someone was talking to him in english all up in his space he'd probably talk back ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ that's just the vibe I get but I don't see him do much from the federal vids I come across
Ricky- face on at all times regardless of which type of fan but he blatantly ignores ssngs
gyuvin- I've seen kssng? that was at the busan pick site with them and I'm not even kidding she took a picture of gyuvin less than a foot away from him and he was just looking at her his boundaries just seem a lot looser
gunwook- has a pretty intense stare ngl he's rlly good at giving interactions but it's usually towards fans the federal vids are just ignoring he's the type to reply if u say smth to him tho
Yujin- ignores everyone I'm trying to just base this off of the videos I see on xhs not everything I see is from sasaengs it's more invasive fans and it really depends on the day, how they feel, what the specific person says or does, if they're a regular or not, location, etc like it all depends. That's just my observation they definitely recognize their sasaengs and frequent fans and they'll treat them accordingly. anyone else can add what they've observed</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#317</span>
