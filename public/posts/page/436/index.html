Hao. chin implant
Hanbin. nose job
Taerae. nose job
Gyuvin. eyelids
Matthew. nose job Non invasive (filler/ botox, most to least, still get's them or stopped):
Hao. chin filler + jaw filler. still (you can literally notice when he gets it done because of how his face reacts to it)
Gyuvin. nose bridge and tip filler + masseter botox. still
Taerae. masseter botox + lip fillers. still
Jiwoong. botox everywhere. still
Gunwook. nose tip filler + masseter botox? idk could be weight loss because his masseter isn't hollow like Gyuvin's. still
Ricky. chin filler. stopped, naturally dissolved by now dunno:
Yujin. dunno cause he's still growing so his changes is highly likely puberty unless he suddenly pops up with a pointy ass chin then it's a chin implant or filler but he hasn't so. ps. matthew naturally has a pointy ass chin I know a lot of anons think he got chin filler but nope, ricky naturally has a round sharp chin too but during in bloom days it was extra pointy and long because of the chin filler but you can tell he never got it refilled because it's back to predebut days where his overbite is really noticeable and chin is still sharp but rounder. pss. other changes in members face can be because of weightloss, facial massages etc.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
