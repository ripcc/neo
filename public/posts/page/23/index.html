woongdeongies - i dont think ive ever seen a single k-wdg but the i-wdgs ive seen are enough to put rank them this high every time i see them on my tl theyre always tweaking over the most unserious shit i.e myseokryudan literally having to post clarifying shes not a jiwoong anti bc she didnt record the ppusamz moment that came before the digimonz + mattparkz clip she posted
riyangis - i just find i-riyangis obsession with feminizing him so weirddd especially on the rps side like they fr kill u if u even think abt him topping 😭 also the way they tweak over rickys lack of social media presence makes me sooo nervous like its only gonna end up backfiring on him
seokryudans - have been extremely hit or miss for me theyve either chill asf or some of the most annoying people ever theyve relaxed with the witch hunting but omg as a baby zerose that was soooo off-putting
kkultaraes / geonpangdans - not much to say but other than azure & her dickriders most of the ones ive seen are chill + with the ost voting so many of them have showed up on my tl & they seem super nice / even tho i interact with a lot of gunwook content i pretty much never see them on my tl other than the ones i follow but from what ive seen on his i-gpds are pretty chill idk abt k-gpds tho ive barely seen any gyuvinists or mulbokdans so i cant rly place them & wow this is so long sryy</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-09-29 22:44:57</small></header><p>wow how'd you end up stanning zb1 I always find anyone post bp interesting but yea I pretty much agree seokryudans were 100000x worse back in the day lemme just say that I forget sometimes but it used to be seokryus and rosins who hated each other more right before the finale lmaoaooo riyangis erm yea.. lots to say ab that bunch but I think there's a noticeable separation now maybe? idk I have a good amt of riyangi anons and they're lit kultaeraes sorry never noticed them they stay in their bubble gpds wow my beoble we used to be up and lit and kickingggg but the public ones are miskeen and dumb but most of the ones ik are private just a shared schizophrenic community gyuvinists are all new I feel like none of the TERRIBLE AND ANNOYING BITCHY ones stan him anymore he lost a lotttt of fans ngl and mulboks never had presence I feel like. This is all in the sense of ifans I feel like I only have a decent grasp on half of the kfandoms and they're different and it would be way too long to add here</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#823</span>

I mean, the anons from the linked posts say haobin go to couple spots and that everyone in the gcs knows or thinks they're together... so, if people in gcs know, surely the crazy ssngs who want to date them would too, no? If so, why haven't they aired their secret or left the fandom. Do they think they can steal hao or hanbin away from the other? 😭 I don't get it.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
