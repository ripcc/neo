And compared to IG that is available to everyone, including Koreans and Koreaboos. So going live in Weibo and speaking Korean is a bit weird. Who are you talking to exactly because even your fans don't understand Korean? It's like going to a Chinese restaurant ordering Korean cuisine & as far as I know, foreigners can't just do live streaming in weibo unless they applied. /+r/143189720510454756</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
