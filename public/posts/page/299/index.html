I wonder how that will work around inkigayo once cb promo starts ?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-02-16 05:56:34</small></header><p>hmmm if it rlly is sunday the only issue would be if the live show clashes with the show filming i thought inki started theirs early so it should be an easy work around</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#11199</span>

<small>2025-02-14 05:57:20</small></header><p>Wow ur rlly the car master but just did a little searching and those cars look cuteeeee they're not too big or small personally I like the honda crvs better but those type of cars are the best I DONT WANT A SEDANNNN</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>ok im back now that neospring is up!!!!! and the honda crv is genuinely such a good choice i own an older model personally but i think the newer models aren't particularly ugly! and also, what you said about hyundai's being like kia soul's, thats because hyundai also makes kias so they're fairly similar in that regard.
but yea anyways honda makes good cars, i would also rec. the toyota rav4 because it's fairly similar and is also reliable! but tbh all newer cars are built worse than they used to be :/ everythings just built bad nowadays so make sure to try your hardest in maintenance so you can make it last a while /+r/148664905011257135</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
