Hao is very outspoken about his feelings for hanbin. Crazy repos aside he singles Hanbin out every time even if the question is open ended or not about him (I ignore his crazy responses where he smirks lmao cause he obv playin there). Like he‚Äôs called Hanbin ‚Äúmy most important person in korea‚Äù ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the person I‚Äôm closest to that‚Äôs the biggest difference‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre closest so i expect and want more from him‚Äù ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help but cry to him, I couldn‚Äôt cry to anyone else‚Äù ‚ÄúÁúüÊ≠£ÊÑè‰πâ‰∏äÁöÑÂàùÊÅã‚Äù ‚Äúmy strong desire to debut was mostly because of him‚Äù only took Hanbin to eat with his mom during a busy schedule. And recently he said ‚Äúwhen I‚Äôm unhappy, if I see him I feel better. If I don‚Äôt see him, I can‚Äôt‚Äù ‚Äúonly Hanbin controls me. No one else dares. Only he can‚Äù
So hao consistently over 2 years has put Hanbin on a pedestal from everyone else. And hao relies on Hanbin emotionally the most (kind of needy in a sense, which we saw when hao was whimpering to Hanbin at the beginning of hbs live).
Hanbin on the other hand talks sweetly about hao but hardly ever puts hao on a pedestal from everyone else. Weirdly enough Hanbin kinda does that with Gyuvin. Recently Hanbin was asked who he can be most honest and selfish with and chose Gyuvin and they‚Äôre always together. Hanbin use to call hao his soulmate and would talk about him more but now mainly talks about Gyuvin helping him emotionally. I know Hanbin loves hao but it‚Äôs less clear if hao is his closest person emotionally. Whether they‚Äôre dating or not is up to ppls perception but to me it‚Äôs been made clear that Hanbin is most important/closest to hao but it‚Äôs not as certain with Hanbin. Ppl can get upset with that but I‚Äôm going based off of words and actions.

they‚Äôre going to answer shit based off of which fan is asking.
gyuvin fan asks hanbin who‚Äôs he‚Äôs most honest and selfish with = he‚Äôs obviously saying gyuvin
if it was a matthew or mattbin fan he would have said matthew if it was a haobin fan he would have said hao. you can‚Äôt take things at face value brah this is idol 101
hao has agreed with shippers shipping hariboz and woonghao. hao has said yujin is his closest friend and gyuvin is the only one he‚Äôs honest with.anybody with a brain knows these are lies brah omg like taking fansign answers so seriously gotta GO the only believable shit is when they‚Äôre talking about actual details/stories/anecdotes like this pmo so bad.. did you all just find out idols can lie or bend the truth in fansigns according to who‚Äôs asking the questionü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 2binz haven‚Äôt ever fought and im seriously stupid to believe hanbin is honest and selfish with him be so fucking früò≠ /+r/158743419588664139</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

If you looks at the general scope of the group it‚Äôs easy to see zh is closer to hb than any other member and it has always been like that, arguably he only even became close to gv because of hb. Whereas hb has always been close to multiple members of the group, like he‚Äôs always been close to mtw, always been close to gv since mentioning hugging him the first time they met on bp, even mentions having long late night talks with gw and seems really close too. It‚Äôs not that hb doesn‚Äôt value zh as much as zh values hb it‚Äôs just hb is a lot obviously closer to more people whereas zh circle is extremely small. Plus like queef said you gotta take these repos with a massive pinch of salt because while I believe they are super close and care for eachother 99% of the repo stuff they say is deffo exaggerated for fs and tbh zh has always been the one to play into fs answers more (regardless of the type of fan) than hb. Like hb does to fs but he‚Äôs more reserved about giving away stuff that would be deemed personal info his fs is very much idol surface level fs where zh will just say some crazy stuff üòÇ /+r/158743419588664139</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I‚Äôm just typing this on break.
Hao is very outspoken about his feelings for hanbin. Crazy repos aside he singles Hanbin out every time even if the question is open ended or not about him (I ignore his crazy responses where he smirks lmao cause he obv playin there). Like he‚Äôs called Hanbin ‚Äúmy most important person in korea‚Äù ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the person I‚Äôm closest to that‚Äôs the biggest difference‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre closest so i expect and want more from him‚Äù ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help but cry to him, I couldn‚Äôt cry to anyone else‚Äù ‚ÄúÁúüÊ≠£ÊÑè‰πâ‰∏äÁöÑÂàùÊÅã‚Äù ‚Äúmy strong desire to debut was mostly because of him‚Äù only took Hanbin to eat with his mom during a busy schedule. And recently he said ‚Äúwhen I‚Äôm unhappy, if I see him I feel better. If I don‚Äôt see him, I can‚Äôt‚Äù ‚Äúonly Hanbin controls me. No one else dares. Only he can‚Äù
So hao consistently over 2 years has put Hanbin on a pedestal from everyone else. And hao relies on Hanbin emotionally the most (kind of needy in a sense, which we saw when hao was whimpering to Hanbin at the beginning of hbs live).
Hanbin on the other hand talks sweetly about hao but hardly ever puts hao on a pedestal from everyone else. Weirdly enough Hanbin kinda does that with Gyuvin. Recently Hanbin was asked who he can be most honest and selfish with and chose Gyuvin and they‚Äôre always together. Hanbin use to call hao his soulmate and would talk about him more but now mainly talks about Gyuvin helping him emotionally. I know Hanbin loves hao but it‚Äôs less clear if hao is his closest person emotionally. Whether they‚Äôre dating or not is up to ppls perception but to me it‚Äôs been made clear that Hanbin is most important/closest to hao but it‚Äôs not as certain with Hanbin. Ppl can get upset with that but I‚Äôm going based off of words and actions.

If he knows a fan is a zerocola and they ask him an open question, 99% of the time he'll say something about Hanbin too because he knows those fans will like that. For example, a luckyz c-fan recently asked him why he always hangs out with Yujin in Japan and he said it was because he feels the most comfortable when he's with Yujin. If we take his answer literally then this would mean he feels more comfortable with Yujin compared to Hanbin. Anon, do you remember all the little stories Hao told about Gunwook when they were still roommates? about how he couldn't fall sleep until Gunwook came back, about how they always talked a lot before going to sleep, or the times they went out together at 3am to walk and have a chat? Damn, I kinda miss gunhao ngl. https://x.com/gunwookiebb/status/1797305320613798150 https://x.com/juleosky/status/1724793950240915802 The point is that he's close to other people besides Hanbin, but he plays things up for fans regardless if they're a zerocola or a stan of another duo or a gf stan. /+r/158743419588664139</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
