The real reason why Zeroses are beefing with Ahgases is because of Rosins. Lemme break it down: some rosins posted that they'll be voting for got7 so zeroses are pissed.
-ahgases asked bambam to help them promote the voting. zeroses were pissed because they think it's unfair since it will draw their fans. he is the most followed kpop soloist in X.
-zb1 won. some ahgases posted that it's ok since zb1 will be disbanding anyway. zeroses were mad saying that ahgases were wishing for zb1 to disband (😳)
-while the above is happening, zeroses were directly quoting bambam & being mean then later said that they were just joking
-the fight intensified because rosins were siding with ahgases and zeroses think that they shouldn't be doing it because they're wishing for zb1 to disband and hao is there
-then bambam replied a laughing emoji on ahgase's post about fighting. zeroses were mad saying that he's being mean to zb1 (i'm sorry i don't get the correlation)
-he was then told that the post he replied to was about ahgases fight with zeroses so he deleted the emoji post and apologized. i saw a post saying that he didn't say sorry and only apologized (😭)
-bambam deleted the apology post. probably upon checking that zeroses were quoting him with mean captions. calling him pedophile (it was the show's mistranslation as per ahgase) and telling him that he should have killed himself.
-ahgases are so mad now because they think that zeroses are too much by directly attacking bambam when they didn't do it with zb1 and the only drag they say is disbandment which they find funny because it was ZB1's contract. *i do think that rosins should be called out for proudly saying that they're voting for got7. then, zeroses should also be called out for directly quoting an artist with mean captions. and ahgases should stop and be the bigger persons. It's sad because we ruined a good relationship when dr dr has 0 chance of winning any music show because it has no physical points</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Also the way they put on mask and there was no photo session after getting of the car, I feel like they trying ninja-ing their way to Thai but the news is all over the place already so yeah🤷‍♀️ let's see for their next official schedule flight, if they still act the same then there is a possibility that wk1 told them to. Zb1 is so friendly with the reporters compared to some idols that I've watched the departure video before

People said sunwoo and hyunjae sfs are the worst of all. I remember when sunwoo's sf attacked a fangirl just because he replied to her weverse account and what trigger them more is when the other fans praising her for her looks and that she looks like sawako (sunwoo and his sawakok obsession) and many more stories about their jealousy

(beijing road), visit the dafo temple, the architecture is cute the pearl river is nice, overall sightseeing is okay if you know what to do Beijing 北京 - I haven't been there in a long time but the summer palace is one of my favorite places ever! Climb it in the summer and then have popsicles next to the lake. Obviously you have to see the forbidden city. The great wall is tiring but the food next to it was so good for some reason. I love beijing breakfast (savory tofu pudding, jianbing, dumplings, youtiao) and the old town Places I really want to go: Xian - didn't go here but I think this is one of the top recommendations because it has a lot of really fascinating history with the terracotta warriors and the old palace, they have a chinese opera there and there are lots of costume shops that will dress you up and do your makeup to take pictures there, and a muslim quarter because there are a lot of hui muslim so the food is really good like lamb kebab and paomo Changsha 长沙 - I didn't go here but I heard it's the food capital of china for really good street eats (spicy food like their crawfish is really popular) and heard from friends that people just go there to eat for several days and they have a very vibrant nightlife scene Lijiang 漓江 - This is in Yunnan province which is where most of the ethnic minorities are. I also haven't been here but I heard from people that have been there that it's really pretty. It has an old town and a snowy mountain lake. The decor inside the old town is cute and instagrammable and the food is diverse and unique because of the ethnic minorities. It has a music scene at night.

The buildings there are gorgeous. It's super overpriced compared to the rest of China though. There's bougie food but their cuisine is very sweet and gentrified. It's not that the shanghainese food is bad, it's just not as flavorful as the rest of china. It was a port city so there's a lot of western influence. Shenzhen 深圳 - comparatively no fun places and shanghai is more "high-tech" the high-tech is such a bubble because it's a worker city so people don't care about recreation, huaqiangbei was cool to see and you can get cheap bootleg electronics but that's it, the food is mid as fuck, just boring don't go there Hangzhou 杭州 - Hangzhou has a really beautiful west lake with willow trees and lotus flowers that you can take a car around, there also pretty silk scarves to buy, that's pretty much all though I thought the food was mid too, very modern though and has a really big tech scene because of being alibaba's hq, I think Suzhou 苏州 is nearby and also has gorgeous scenery and good reviews though (1/3) /+r/139247592491146228</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
