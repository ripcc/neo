Hao is very outspoken about his feelings for hanbin. Crazy repos aside he singles Hanbin out every time even if the question is open ended or not about him (I ignore his crazy responses where he smirks lmao cause he obv playin there). Like he‚Äôs called Hanbin ‚Äúmy most important person in korea‚Äù ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the person I‚Äôm closest to that‚Äôs the biggest difference‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre closest so i expect and want more from him‚Äù ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help but cry to him, I couldn‚Äôt cry to anyone else‚Äù ‚ÄúÁúüÊ≠£ÊÑè‰πâ‰∏äÁöÑÂàùÊÅã‚Äù ‚Äúmy strong desire to debut was mostly because of him‚Äù only took Hanbin to eat with his mom during a busy schedule. And recently he said ‚Äúwhen I‚Äôm unhappy, if I see him I feel better. If I don‚Äôt see him, I can‚Äôt‚Äù ‚Äúonly Hanbin controls me. No one else dares. Only he can‚Äù
So hao consistently over 2 years has put Hanbin on a pedestal from everyone else. And hao relies on Hanbin emotionally the most (kind of needy in a sense, which we saw when hao was whimpering to Hanbin at the beginning of hbs live).
Hanbin on the other hand talks sweetly about hao but hardly ever puts hao on a pedestal from everyone else. Weirdly enough Hanbin kinda does that with Gyuvin. Recently Hanbin was asked who he can be most honest and selfish with and chose Gyuvin and they‚Äôre always together. Hanbin use to call hao his soulmate and would talk about him more but now mainly talks about Gyuvin helping him emotionally. I know Hanbin loves hao but it‚Äôs less clear if hao is his closest person emotionally. Whether they‚Äôre dating or not is up to ppls perception but to me it‚Äôs been made clear that Hanbin is most important/closest to hao but it‚Äôs not as certain with Hanbin. Ppl can get upset with that but I‚Äôm going based off of words and actions.
Damn this was too long my bad üò≠</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
