Like I’ve accepted that regardless of rank/ popularity/ company literally anything. Mnet like hanbin. It’s undeniable, they like him and he fits what they want for their stuff so it really doesn’t matter about background at all because like queef and other anons have said other managements have the same and if not more involvement in the group. They were still going to choose him because they like him and that’s just how it is.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

They still kept using KD when he left and sued a CJ-related company. Hanbin is known for being good to staff and that's how you secure future gigs. I also see that with mbc and gyuvin.
