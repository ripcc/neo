a car i hate so much is the new hyundai santa fe. i keep getting stuck behind people with the 2024/25 santa fe and it pisses me awf so bad like why does it look like that??? just gross. also for a 3 seater car i would've expected more than just a 4-cylinder engine, but then again maybe the less cylinders makes it easier to replace when the engine inevitably blows up. classic hyundai, build shitty ass cars. sorry this turned into a hyundai hate post. i just don't like them.
also sorry for the whole blabbing about cars. honestly i want to hear your opinion on cars more than i want to hear your opinion on kpop. this isn't even hate i just care more about cars tbh.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
