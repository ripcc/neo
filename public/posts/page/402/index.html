But I guess what I was getting at is that if you really think about it, it's not that crazy at all, because the kinds of things some of these idols are being taking down for (I know the Seunghan sitch is a little more complicated since i-fans are hyper-focused on the dating/sex stuff over everything else) are frequently things I don't think anyone, let alone a young person, can properly account for even with vigilant preparation and the fear of god instilled in them. I guess what rubs me the wrong way is how a failure to comply with kpop standards ("regular human things") is treated as a moral failure regardless of the severity of the act itself simply because being an idol is this covetable, powerful position (I'd argue it's not actually institutionally powerful, but I'm running out of steam) and thus it's always also implied they are committing the crime of taking their position for granted."</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-15 02:27:40</small></header><p>Sorry u sent it off anon but I can agree its just being an idol is a transactional profession so the reactions and whats considered wrong are real skewed this opinion obviously lies outside of intl spaces and its more severe in recent years (postpandemic kpop) but i mean depending on status seniority and maybe situation? its given more grace 😅 but i think its just one of the darker things we gotta accept as kpop fans but i get you totally</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#1349</span>

That age is when they're going through so much confusion and they tend to do shit, idol or not. But there will be difference if an idol started training young before or during that age because if they're gearing to idols, they should know how to present themselves since the industry is fucked up. Very good example, Hao and Wonyoung. When Hao was 13, he didn't know that he'll be a Kpop idol. He was just living his normal teenage life which could get him hated easily if he happened to be Korean. Meanwhile, Wonyoung started so young . She knew what she wanted and made sure that any bitch will only find how professional of an idol she is ever since she decided to go that path. But yes, let's criticize all the adult idols who are still doing shit knowing that they should be protecting themselves, especially if they're in a group because they accepted this life. Whatever they do will affect not only themselves but their groupmates or future groups too. I'm talking about Uncle.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
