But now other chinese zerocolas who know chinese are mad because op never directly said 'making out' so noyb is putting words into their mouth and we all know noyb adds her two cents to make the problem bigger to incite ifans but dont get me wrong zerocolas are still pissed at op for even asking that question they're just mad that the translation isnt accurate making things look 'worst'.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I then sent you an anon like a month after that saying I got it. So, I did get it, and now I’m working for a Governor rn that’s getting a LOT of attention on social media. I won’t say which one because there are a few popping off rn BUT imagine how insane it’d be for a freaking anon from this page to end up working for the future president of the United States come 2028 (if they run and are elected and I stay with their office god willing) 💀 . I’d be carrying my Gunwook photocard through the halls of the White House like an emotional support teddy bear 😭.
