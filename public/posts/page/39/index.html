I'm guessing this is the subtext of the less unhinged criticism he's facing from k-fans, but I mean I can't blame i-fans for not picking up on that. Also I didn't type all this as a fan of him, and the people making him out to be a martyr are doing too much in the other direction as always, but yeah considering most people on the i-side especially are only privy to cherry-picked parts of his scandals, it's not surprising to see this convo re-surface and the scolds of both sides righteously ramp up. Also girl don't worry about word-vomiting, I genuinely appreciate it lol. I feel bad inundating people with my paragraphs I can't be brief and succinct for my life.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-15 02:45:17</small></header><p>yea when you consider the fact that he had scandal predebut then apologized more scandal afterward with the ig lives, bad stories, and the threat of exposing more then apologized and went on hiatus CAME BACK apologized and had more exposed. Its not even about the morality of his actions and the response hes a huge liability especially since his group directly benefitted from his hiatus and made feats he wasnt present for so really he shouldnt have been made to come back and all that wouldve been avoided but ifans think the things he got exposed for didnt matter so here we are. And no i didnt think you meant it in his defense lol it was a good discussion piece I like reading what yall gotta say i wish i could be more active so it could be more frequent</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#4980</span>

From what I know he went to a private kindergarten in shanghai then after a few years he transferred to an international school then I don't know how many years passed he came to the states, he then went to Portola then transferred to OCSA then he came to Korea. Like he never really stayed in one place long enough or had time to establish a deep friendship so it makes sense why he's so introverted and prefers to do things alone and don't have many close friends.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And, NO, before anyone says it’s not because he’s gay or possibly autistic 😒. People using that as an excuse to go against anyone who says anything not favorable about him is annoying. It’s weird because I really think Gyuvin has matured a lot this past year and my impression of him got way better, but as Taerae got more comfortable and got more “shady” I started liking him less. They swapped. I think taerae is a very observant person and actually has foresight and thinks ahead and uses it to his advantage. He’s smart, you can tell. But like he’s smart in a way that can come off as pretentious, and he inserts himself in situations focused on others at times. Saying things like “I wouldn’t have done that…” “NO ONE would think that” “WE would’ve done it different”. Istg he’s done this multiple times in several different variety shows. It’s like asserting yourself and making generalized statements that assume how other people would act or react, which comes off as rude to others who don’t agree with the generalized comment. Most people do it every now and then but it’s rare; Taerae does it fairly often which makes him seem or act a little pretentious. I used to do the same shit in early high school too so I think that’s why I picked up on it but a lot of people don’t notice it. I also noticed on top of the statements, and other people have pointed it out too, his clinginess is a little much. I do think Taerae will mature out of it but who knows. He’s a complex character but people who don’t fuck with him because of these things are super valid.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
