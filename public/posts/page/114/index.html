I have noticed that usually those fancams that get more views are usually the ones when the kfans really like the hemeco (hair makeup and outfit) and the dance. there is no co relation to likes and views because the same fans watch the video multiple times because they really like it. It is easy to identify what they like, just by their reaction to a performance. For example if Gunwook had a mr mr fancam, I think it would do pretty good numbers compared to his other fancams, because I know everyone liked his look that day. Hanbin's perfume fancam was the same. And for Hao, I kept seeing his kfans posting his visuals in the beginning of the mr mr performance but the clip is not from the fancam. So it can be because they really liked his look that day. Also this is coming from someone who believes fans aren't going to spend money on their idol's fancam views so it is just my opinion.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I also sometimes call idols fat(only male idols, not your gunwook) because I feel insecure about my body (I weigh 48kg) and I'm not actually fat but not thin like winter. So, everytime I see posts like these, it makes me feel bad for other aespa members especially Karina (they are obviously shading her) because I feel like I relate to them. I learnt from the quotes that karina fans also shade winter by calling her skeleton but still it doesn't feel as personal as this one because I don't relate to it at all.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Personally I also hate them but at the same time I'm also thankful. Do you know what would happen if my sf don't have these crazies? Gunwook fandom. Always cater to ot9, always protecting ot9 over their own, when someone said they would regret their choice to okay-ing these ot9s over their own they proudly say their bias gonna be proud of them for prioritizing his teammates, now look at where they are and look at what happen to their bias. No job, no line, none of these ot9 who scream about stop sexualizing gunwook, stop protesting about him, stop asking for more just wait patiently, stop making things bigger than they are, other members need us ot9 more than him right now bla bla bla care to spend even some minutes to stream for him or promote him. How can you trust when the result of trusting ot9s is right in front of our eyes?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
