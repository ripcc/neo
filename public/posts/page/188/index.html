Idgaf about the arguments: yes min hee Jin is weird, yes HYBE sucks ass, YADDA YADDA YADDA but NO ONE can objectively deny those girls aren‚Äôt doing something absolutely insane and deserve a little respect for it. What they‚Äôre doing could very much lead to higher workers rights for idols and maybe, just maybe, idol unionism in like a decade or so. They are building upon what TVXQ did over 15 years ago and by going directly against a conglomerate, genuinely exposing the company‚Äôs insane fraud and actual plans to get rid of them, and by getting almost universal support from the general public except insane HYBE worshipers, they are creating a shift towards not only idol loyalty to a company but also widespread support for an artist against their conglomerate company. With TVXQ support was split about half/half, now it‚Äôs almost fully for artists on NewJeans case. Creating a burn account to go against your own company was insanely brave. Even if they were ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù into doing it, it doesn‚Äôt take away the potential consequences of it and the bravery. If NewJeans are able to survive and succeed and thrive, it‚Äôll encourage other idols to coming to light with their own exploitation stories on a bigger platform rather than just the rare interview a decade after their careers died or like an odd few shady comments. NewJeans are the ones actually changing the idol industry. And I‚Äôm saying this as someone who found their music generic and didn‚Äôt like their vocal skills. What they are doing are also stirring up conversations of workers rights in South Korea, like damn.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-31 10:50:18</small></header><p>the mhj hate really skewed a lot of this case internationally that really got me ik it was mainly army/hybe company fans pedaling it but the fact that shes brought up negatively in every new turn kinda just felt like the real issues were being buried and it hindered a lot of new jeans support because theyd be transparent about reaching out to her and boom it would get villainized. Im not saying she isnt weird but people trying to make her albeit unprofessional relationship with the girls seem pedophilic and that theyre brainwashed and selling themselves to her rubbed me the wrong wayyyyyy thats why i feel like were here. Since the beginning ive been on their side and the live was truly the best thing they couldve done people dont realize their fate was going to be sealed as a forgotten punished group under hybe like we gotta give it to them theyre integral and if a hybe blockade really does happen itll be because of them take that yunjin üòù</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#5080</span>

Like not in a fun slay way, like genuinely one to be mean but also act overly friendly with people in public but lock eyes with you so you know they do have the capacity of being nice but actively choose not to be towards you. Other idols in this category: Key in like 2015 (he‚Äôs grown out of it now), and Chanhee in a more subdued way (sometimes he‚Äôs just rude af tho outright). I love my sisters but people can feel the mean girls energy from them. And no I‚Äôm not calling this just because they‚Äôre gay üôÑ they just have that vibe. Other gay idols don‚Äôt serve that, like Hao, Sunoo, that one TWS dude, Yves, etc.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
