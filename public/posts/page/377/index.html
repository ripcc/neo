Hanni is so instrumental in all of these. I'm glad that the haters focused on Hanni because if not for what she said, none of these hybe shits will come out. They can't even drag Hanni because they will come out as Xenophobic. I think, everything happens for a reason and favors NJ's side the most. Hybe is meant to be exposed & go down.

If she was on Aespa, the vocal disparity between her and the others would be too much.
