Belle does the same thing, and moves her chin in the same sort of unnatural way and looks uncomfortable when she opens her mouth fully. I’ve never had a chin implant so I can’t speak 100% on it but it wouldn’t shock me if it’s a little weird to fully open your mouth with it, especially with chin implants that are that big or don’t fit exactly well. The skin is stretched over the extra protruding part, so it makes sense it’s a little tight idk 🤷‍♀️</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
