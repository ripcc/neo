I feel liek these collabs are a hybe planned they bring on a zb1 member to collab because they know we have the biggest core fanbase and nobody would tune in if there wasn’t a zb1 member, then they give most of lines and center time to their hybe idol to make them stand out when it’s just them leeching off our fame like bnd usually does.

MV views? guys, we don't have organic "momentum".😭 Our views are paid for by Wakeone and Allins. Not to mention the innate laziness of our fandom. This is why it's hard to create this illusion that we're doing good because some people won't bother moving.the biggest factor is actually the fact that there's nothing interesting to watch now. they don't add something new. same old boring routine /+r/07295200ab</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
