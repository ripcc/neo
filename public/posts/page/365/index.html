If the MCs and some members hadn't pushed themselves too hard, the atmosphere would have been so bad that it would have been impossible to continue. It's not that they're doing badly because they're rookies, but it's like they were dragged out of a public place against their will. I was looking forward to seeing the members for the first time in a long time, but I was embarrassed the whole time. I think from next time, only the members who want to appear should appear” and then a kgpd qrt then mentioning hanbin and then it just tunred into burner accounts going back and forth and dying off into personal insults. Tbh I’m still not sure what the issue actually was, no one on the I side said anything even the akgaes so I guess it’s died over there now. /+r/140869963996157005</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

It has been long since he last did a live, I have been seeing a lot of gyuvin live clips on my tl than hanbin's. I feel so starved, I thought he'd do it today. And the dc allins aren't demanding him for any live broadcast these days. Why are they acting all nice now? I just saw a post saying they would like to see him do live broadcast but they aren't spamming him in pluschat asking for it anymore. Those dc girls have been in their best behavior lately despite the drought. And tomorrow zb1 will travel to japan so I can't get it tomorrow either.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
