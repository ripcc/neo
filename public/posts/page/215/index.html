I'm really curious what her status is because she's everywhere, if she was their stylist she would not be boarding with them in public. That's why I'm leaning towards that she has to be related to someone important in Wakeone either girlfriend of the CEO or niece or something and that's why she just lingers around everywhere and get to go to these fancy events when ZB1 is invited.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

<small>2024-09-28 08:06:01</small></header><p>I'll list it out by member jiwoong - go enlist brudda
hao - tbh my wish is lowkey him being a soloist in korea but that's near impossible a group is aight but i think it would more be fun exploring his sound
hanbin - not in a group or a soloist I think he should pursue dance and stay within in that mc presenter realm I don't think he suits variety but some kind of YouTube show idk
matthew - I'd want to see him in a group again I don't rlly see much when it comes to his future besides being in a group but my ideal would be redebuting with gunwook 😝
taerae - I don't think he should go solo yet I think about it and it could work but also I guess my dislike for evnne runs deep I wouldn't wish that on him but he's most likely going there. but if that sm trot group does well let's put him in the next one
ricky - I can see him being independent and trying to break into that social media and fashion world but I'm a fan and I'm selfish but also debuting in a group is iffy the only possibility I can think of is yuehuaz and well there's been no cult glazing including him so idk a part of me thinks he'd still wanna be an idol too idk
gyuvin - well he can go ahead and debut in yuehuaz that's really his dying wish but maybe he'll try to pursue some flop acting maybe end up like younghoon
gunwook - goatie... i have a 10 year plan play book for his future he's definitely going to be in a group and I have hope he'll leave yuehua my ultimate dream is redebuting with yujin and matthew but I would wanna see him tapping into ultimate artistry and producing his own solo music YEZGAWD HENNEY
yujin - i think he has the most potential and debuting with yuehua is likely and a good choice for him uhmm maybe he's even get bought out and do even better i think about his future the least tbh And in terms of management uh idk hopefully whatever they got is better than this and they can finally tap into things they're all tailored to and get good promo like wow even for the members I don't care ab lets shoot for better yall we don't have to be popular just make good money and do things u like uhhh and promo that matches well wow this too damn long</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#7004</span>

Hao: 난 빛나 (Here I Am)
Gyuvin : What? Oh don't tell me, is Ricky singing too loud in the shower again?😭
Matthew: wordlessly points towards the Hybe leak Everyone gathers and reads silently, they are speechless when they see explicit details about their personal lives in the document
Matthew: tears welling up how could they know all this unless...
Hao: Someone betrayed us!
Hanbin: gulps b-but hyung how do they know about that time in the car I thought we were alone
Gyuvin : that time you guys started dancing really hard in the car, making it shake a lot?
Gunwook : gasps Gyubinie! That's not it
Hao: That can't be... I've only told this to one person...Soobin is my best friend, he wouldn't do this to me!
Yujin: gently pats Haos back but Hyung...it can only be him
Hao: maybe...b-but what about &amp;team?! Isn't Matthew friends with them?
Matthew: No way! they have things on me I've never shared to anyone
Ricky: reading the part on Matthew So it really was you who stole my strawberry milkshake!
Matthew " gulps well I better get going... Gunwook : Guys let's not fight...let's think about this logically, it could also be myung jaehyun!
Hanbin : gasps B-b-but he's my friend, he wouldn't do something like this!
Gunwook : shakes Hanbins shoulders Hyung! Get over yourself! It can only be him
Hanbin : wiping off his tears you're right..let's get done with this once and for all
Taerae: Ok so, Hanbin, distract him! Gunwook, you'll handle him! Hao, you'll interrogate him! Jiwoong...uh you just be Jiwoong! It's time to KILL THE ROMEO
