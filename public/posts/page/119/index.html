Like in every aspect zb1 cleared like not even biased they are without a doubt 5th genâ€™s best performers like even if I was a non fan the other groups energy and stage presence isnâ€™t the same and Iâ€™m guessing they all sang live / semi live but wow you could really see bnd relying on the backing.

Like from what Iâ€™ve seen of your responses you probably think they are together but that doesnâ€™t mean you care to put your energy and time into them. You just know their tea from other sources.
Secondly even though ik itâ€™s a broken record, I find it super funny when some anons like this one come here pressed trying to claim woonghao/myungbin are together because of some little fanservice moments compared to everything off cam/privately Haobin haveâ€¦ Iâ€™m not gonna type out why Ik Haobin are genuinely real cause thereâ€™s literally no point and I can do that elsewhere.
