Ateez never break streaming records or get much domestic traction besides the hot chili pepper song. Praying thatâ€™s the same for Riize so at least thereâ€™ll be less of a competition in Korea. Ik zb1 isnâ€™t ever going to be the same since the Jiwoong thing but maybe something beneficial can happen in the absence of SM monopoly.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
