I don't think anything points towards may and just going off the timeline of spoilers and when their japan cb is it seems like they're following an identical plan to 2024 just 2 months earlier so I say March for that reason. I still think that's too late even omg a May cb would break my heart LIKE THATS ACTUALLY SO UPSETTING AND SAD THEY BETTERRRRRRR NOT IM SO SERIOUS their last cb would've been in august they wasted an entire quarter on an asia tour then had a Japanese cb late january like the nerve of them that sounds 10x worse than this entire year everyone start praying</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#254</span>

I've seen some Japanese accounts showing proofs that they voted for Taerae just so they can speak up about the FBs doing all the promos for Taerae's which they didn't do for Hao's and ZB1 marketing reason is that they didn't do individual voting before to avoid SF war because another member was nominated when Hao was the only one nominated that time. And Zeroseville not talking about this and call out the FBs is just promoting the narrative that Zeroses don't care about Hao the way they do with other members. It's just saddening to see this happen with how much Hao contributed in ZB1.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Pastor: If you declare with your mouth, ‚ÄúJesus is Lord,‚Äù and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
Romans 10:9
Gyuvin: ah preacher man this is really, really such a touching sentence and it reminded me of something sung hanbitna told me the other day..he told me "aigo gyubinie drink carefully" and it made me think that if I had drank alcohol and gotten alcohol poisoning, hanbin would have saved me, because i believed it with all my heart I started crying, hanbin Hyung gave me a pat on the back and somehow it brought me back to boys planet..I called ricky to tell him this story and also that I want to get married to him</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
