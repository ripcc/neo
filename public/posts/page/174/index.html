Two members of the winning group are under pocketdol/mbk ent. (probably the shittiest company rn in the industry/they have a few groups but most currently known is BAE 173.). One of the BAE 173 guys made it into the group alongside a trainee from the company. Group name is CLOSEYOUREYES (CYE). Recently the company controlling CYE posted on their groups official social media that two contestant’s company was preventing them from knowing where two of the CYE members are, that said alleged company was trying to force a member of CYE to cross promote with their original group during their time in CYE (they didn’t say the exact name but they were talking about pocketdol cuz basically Hangyul from BAE 173 is doing stuff rn too for BAE 173 despite just making it into the Starlight Boy’s survival show wining lineup “Polarix” and they were essentially expecting the BAE 173 guy that made it into CYE to do the same) and that they (CYE’s company) was going to report the two trainees as missing. PocketDol essentially puts out a response that says “no we didn’t kidnap them also they’re our trainees we can use them however we want lol”. Then more statements or comments come out basically subtweeting each other in increasingly antagonistic jargon. The PD OF PROJECT 7 POSTS AN ADOLF HITLER QUOTE ON INSTA THAT SAYS “if you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed” AND PUTS “fuck evil” IN THE CAPTION. Some contestants from project 7 that didn’t make it likes the post. Keep in mind that PocketDol has done this before with Chaeyeon from I.O.I. (forced her to promote with her group DIA while also promoting with I.O.I. (the first group thay came out of the Produce survival shows), which ended up causing her to sit out big I.O.I. events and actually caused a huge wave of hate towards her not being devoted enough to her actual popular group).</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Like they probably bought the albums in advance, expected it to sale or just wanted to deceive their sells numbers, and return them when they realized they weren’t getting what they wanted. 100k albums is insane. This + the fact they lost 2 sponsorships including Pocari (AND the fact New Jeans were declared the biggest kpop act in 2024 by the Japanese music charts) oh illit have a lot against them. They might be done tbh. Not to be like “they’re old” because they are like what, a year old? But their reputation + the fact they already lost huge sponsors are going to follow them for years. During that time there very well might be new girl groups to flock over to (especially the new SM girl group). Allegedly Min Hee Jin also privately submitted to the court over a thousand instances of Belift copying her, and like a thousand things of evidence is pretty damning 😭 idk 🤷 I knew since their survival show they might be cursed. It’s just so much</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
