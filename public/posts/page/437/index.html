Gyuvin knew when to sing and I respect that at least he's really trying
Jiwoong... yeah he should lipsync the whole thing he's not good dhzjksllz
Ngl I don't want to be too harsh on him because I see the potential but yujin really doesn't try sgsjskls like there's songs where they barely move they're literally sitting down for goodnight and the only thing he sings live is the good night at the end lmaol</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

But period the ones who sing live less aren't dead weight and agree they sound better Ricky's def more stable and wow I might have to clap for gyuvin just last year he was smiling instead of singing a couple adlibs okay brothaaaa. I hate hate hate jiwoongs voice so yea I'd rather not hear it sound any worse than the studio version and eh yea maybe yujin will get there he used to not sing his lines at all so jdjfngjmdmksksks</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#299</span>

K-Soul, that one Chinese trainee that made it to the group but no one knows his true age. He’s been on several survival shows in China and Korea and I think he tried a Japanese one but I’m not sure, either way he wrote down different years on different shows so no one knows if he was born from 1996-2002, odds are 1997 or 1998 but 🤷‍♀️. He also accused one of the trainers of the show of being racist because he wasn’t given a part he wanted (keep in mind he’s not a rapper, it was a rapping part, he was already center AND he already had the most amount of lines and was trying to take the only lines the other guy had). He’s made fatphobic comments several times to some of his future members during the show, talk backed to the mentors several times to the point that Soyeon snickered when he was announced in the group, wore twists, and made some uncomfortable sexual jokes with one of the Maknaes (he was 13/14 years old btw, he was born in 2009 to put it into context😭). And he shades/makes mean comments for the sake of “joking” but really they’re coming at the expense of others. It’s just an all around mess.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

The news came out the literally same day Jo announced his first Hiatus. The ceo has already been replaced but there have been sightings of Jo at school a couple months after the news of his hiatus. All this stuff is semi-viral on Korean Twitter btw. If I was to realistically guess what actually happened (taking into consideration the stabbing rumor), the old CEO might’ve hurt him repeatedly but went the extra level and cut him (not bad enough to not go to school after a few months but still not great) and now Jo is (understandably so) done with the company and idol life (plus he was bullied relentlessly for his hair, don’t forgot on top of likely abuse he was bullied).
