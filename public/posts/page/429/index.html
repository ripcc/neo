I think this year was easier and also more expensive because of how bad they're pushing this whole tourism thing but 375 for this lineup would never go in america it would be 1k AT LEASTTTTTTTT https://files.catbox.moe/07figx.jpeg and this was my view</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><span class=index>#7397</span>
