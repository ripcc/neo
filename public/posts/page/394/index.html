Irl people hiding their identity means you don’t know who would vote Trump or wish to own you in the past or are raging incels. You don’t 100% know with anyone, even actual idols, but at least irl you can get a better read on people. I get the privacy argument for vr but maybe just be a lyricist rather than trying to be an idol or vtuber who interact in real time with the public and have goals to accumulate a fanbase. I also keep getting reminded of dream, and how big the backlash will be if like 95% of famous vr people ever got leaked. Like you see who PLAVE actually are???? And how one of the guys got leaked and had to apologize for a misogynistic rap he wrote back in his irl idol days? Yeah :/</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
