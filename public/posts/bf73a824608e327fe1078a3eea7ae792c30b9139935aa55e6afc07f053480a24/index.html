I don't think he's manipulative and shady if anything he's an extreme overthinker and sometimes struggles to place his emotions accurately. If you only ever watch him in group variety shows because you don't give a fuck about him and don't check on his solo stuff and messages how would you even know? Saying he's manipulative and outright shady when he always shows he cares for his members in his own ways (giving them music lessons, writing songs for matthew, getting closer to ricky who clearly struggles to feel included sometimes etc.), saying he's too clingy when he only ever does it to two members (yujin and gyuvin) to show he cares (he used to do the same thing to jihoo and munjung, it's what he always does to younger members who he cares about) it all sounds a bit too much, it's not unlikely that gyuvin said something hurtful to him considering he was depressed as fuck for the past few months and that gyuvin often speaks before he thinks and there's been tension sometime before that even sometimes gyuvin literally looked like he wanted to off himself when Taerae literallt just held his shoulder or whatever, anyway I don't think it's fair to judge Taerae on anything if you don't even pay attention to him outside of group variety shows</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
