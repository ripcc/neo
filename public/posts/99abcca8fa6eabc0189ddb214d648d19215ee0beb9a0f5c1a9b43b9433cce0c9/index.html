Bc Itzy released a song called "weapon" for street girls fighter and ngl the song was good and at the time it was one of their better releases bc it was during their sneakers era, but the song was too high for all of them, and although the choreo was also great they never performed it live either. There's only clips of the dance line dancing to it on vlive. off anon</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

But im sure the members will sing it on live or smth like that but an actual performance i dont see it happening</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
