I’ve noticed in general as tour was coming to and end and now award show season has started the group in general seem more happier ? Idk like a couple months ago they were so obviously down in the dumps but recently they all seems a lil better and I think you can tell with with little things like this like the change in tone are being kinder to himself sounds better than how he would have been a couple months ago. My logic also is that he hasn’t had to do any fan calls for over a month so he hasn’t had any fans going at him for his weight so that probably helps too 😭</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
