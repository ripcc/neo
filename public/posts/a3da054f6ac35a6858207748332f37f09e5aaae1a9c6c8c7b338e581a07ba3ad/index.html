He looked fine but obviously in videos in the venue the blonde was barely noticeable and looked all dark which was better. I actually think he looked better today than he has in ages and now that he slimmed out a lot in the face it’s definitely better for him to stick to dark hair rather than light, especially his brows they are dark again ans he looks so much better</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
