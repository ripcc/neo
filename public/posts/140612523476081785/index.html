But while I do think he's capable of just doing this for whatever reason I talked to someone and they theorized he probably got some shitty news from yuehua like he's getting shipped off or smth I just felt like replying with this but it doesn't change anything at all it's still immature and distasteful idk if I'm there yet with actively sabotaging the group but hes at terrorist status</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/139907196166296449 class=replyLink>/+r/139907196166296449</a>i thought he knew he was going to get shipped off to china after zb1, its no wonder because he keeps on targeting and amusing his cfans. if he held lives only speaking in korean i would get him wanting to stay in korea but he does not. he mostly speaks chinese and his comment section is also full of chinese comments. it was clear as water</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
