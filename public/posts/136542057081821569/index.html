(why would it take him 7 months to realize this.) there's absolutely nothing in my room right now. just the floor. (‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è) so when the bed gets here, i'll decorate the room nicely.‚Äù How can someone who seems to shop a lot live in a room for almost 2 years and still have no personal belongings in there. Like look at the other members rooms you can tell that they live there no one else has an empty room omfg it makes no sense</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

We gotta rmbr they don't spend most of their time in rooms like regular people they're always traveling and working so there's not gonna be personal belongings and especially if half of a shared room was cleared out rky is type B downnnn he's not decorating üò≠</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/135777398137508182 class=replyLink>/+r/135777398137508182</a>He likes to shop but I don't think he means it literally as in buying things, I think it's more about walking around, browsing and window shopping because he's picky af and he's also really minimalistic if you pay attention he always wears the same thing over and over again so to me he seems like quality over quantity type and decorating just never crossed his mind cause he dgaf about it. I had a college dormmate and all they brought from home was bedding and clothes the entire semester while my side was decorated with plushies, polaroids, stationary, night stand etc like some people just don't care and its okay üò≠</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
