If you're pit from the idol's perspective you only see from their eyebrows and above and usually they have their phones in front of their faces with signs so they're probably reading something and from that distance they're usually looking at a group of 20 ppl but because of perspective it looks like they're looking at you 😭 I just crack tf up when I see vids like this it's just so funny 😭😭😭😭😭 But again I too would be delulu af like yas tartar wants me bad 😍</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-30 04:41:21</small></header><p>? No there's a large distance between pits and stages to avoid that if the members can recognize their favorite fansites from pits I think they can see pretty clearly but yea it's easy to give a personal perspective to a group of people that's why people always get confused on who got special interactions and who didn't like those rosins and hao. BUT EXACTLY I WOULD TURN DEMONIC IF I GOT THAT😂😂😂✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️ they were def looking at that girl tho u can tell with how frequent her interactions were and constant eye contact breaking</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
