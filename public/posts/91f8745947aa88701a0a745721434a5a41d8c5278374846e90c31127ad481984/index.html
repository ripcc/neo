I just think it's silly to police someone's account to this extent iirc this is not the first time people have jumped her for cropping hanbin out which is normal for solo focused accounts and she does for other members too, she's not hao's biggest fanacc either and most of the people complaining are rps trolls who have many places they can look at for haobin material</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
