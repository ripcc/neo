Why did it become like this? I remember the time when gunwook's arms weren't even as muscular as Hao and Ricky's arms used to be super skinny. there was a time when the members were teasing Ricky for wearing sleeveless while not having muscles in one of their content. Not even Yujin, Hao, Hanbin are spared. Hanbin's arms used to be nice before. Taerae's arms are the only one I like right now. And I originally never liked muscly arms like Jiwoong and Matthew. Skinny with little muscles is a bit acceptable.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
