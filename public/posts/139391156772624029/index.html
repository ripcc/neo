(beijing road), visit the dafo temple, the architecture is cute the pearl river is nice, overall sightseeing is okay if you know what to do Beijing åŒ—äº¬ - I haven't been there in a long time but the summer palace is one of my favorite places ever! Climb it in the summer and then have popsicles next to the lake. Obviously you have to see the forbidden city. The great wall is tiring but the food next to it was so good for some reason. I love beijing breakfast (savory tofu pudding, jianbing, dumplings, youtiao) and the old town Places I really want to go: Xian - didn't go here but I think this is one of the top recommendations because it has a lot of really fascinating history with the terracotta warriors and the old palace, they have a chinese opera there and there are lots of costume shops that will dress you up and do your makeup to take pictures there, and a muslim quarter because there are a lot of hui muslim so the food is really good like lamb kebab and paomo Changsha é•¿æ²™ - I didn't go here but I heard it's the food capital of china for really good street eats (spicy food like their crawfish is really popular) and heard from friends that people just go there to eat for several days and they have a very vibrant nightlife scene Lijiang æ¼“æ±Ÿ - This is in Yunnan province which is where most of the ethnic minorities are. I also haven't been here but I heard from people that have been there that it's really pretty. It has an old town and a snowy mountain lake. The decor inside the old town is cute and instagrammable and the food is diverse and unique because of the ethnic minorities. It has a music scene at night.
