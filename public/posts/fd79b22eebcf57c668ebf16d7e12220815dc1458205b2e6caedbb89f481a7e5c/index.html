Plus he deffo forgot the password to some of his account hence why they are still up and easy to link to his other socials. Minghao wasn’t having socials like that as a kid and no one was keeping tabs on him the same way they were hao who was known around his uni. There probably is tea but I think that’s the disadvantage to debuting or becoming a trainee older, you’ve gone through most of your developmental stages free from the rules and expectations of being an idol which means a lot of what was said and done is unfiltered</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
