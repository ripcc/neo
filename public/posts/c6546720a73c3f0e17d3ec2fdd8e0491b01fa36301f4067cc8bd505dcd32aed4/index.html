YUCK I feel like something happened that fucked him up mentally and he's using alcohol and partying to cope. I saw one of his speeches at one of his tours or something and he legit sounds crazyyy. Both Jackson and BamBam are going through it, Mark lowkey depressed, JB has also openly talked about his depression and getting treatment like I need to know what happened with Got7</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
