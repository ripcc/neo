I liked their music but I had never checked out their stages and knew maybe like 1 members name. Fast forward and now that I’m actually reading up on everything I’m kind of amazed they did what they did and I think in a couple years when army’s lose a little more relevance more people will talk about the impact their ability to go against HYBE had. Like, no they aren’t being beat or abused in the same way as TVXQ was, but what they did is most similar to what TVXQ/JYJ did years ago in the context of going against the biggest entertainment conglomerate. Also their fight (even if you think them being ignored doesn’t matter) is going to set precedence for years to come. The legal status of idols as workers, the possibility of unionization, fair rights, sick leave, contract breaks, artistic freedom, etc. EVERYTHING will be affected. I know a lot of fans don’t care about the politics of it but they should, especially if they constantly complain about the treatment of their idol. Also flaunting the shit your idol went through in an attempt to go against new jeans claims and paint them as entitled is stupid af, like congrats, jimin has an eating disorder and Enhypen are one more tour stop away from cardiac arrest??? Think bigger like pleaseeeee, the implications matter, especially in post-Westernization kpop. Don’t you want better for your idol? But for the sake of your ego and weird loyalty to a corporation that pumps plastic into the ocean and funds IDF warfare you’re going against the ones obviously in the right. It’s just so stupid. Last thing I’ll say is that new jeans are actually good performers, and this is coming from someone who had never seen their stages until a few days ago. They are charismatic and can dance, singing is still meh but good in comparison to other HYBE groups (except seventeen/fromis_9). They aren’t nearly bad enough for the drags they are getting. It’s all pettiness</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
