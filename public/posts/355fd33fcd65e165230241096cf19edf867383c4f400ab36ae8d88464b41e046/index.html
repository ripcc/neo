After some time I started looking up pics and videos of him because the hate trains got me curious who this guy actually is and grew to like him even if he got surgery because all kpop idols got some done lbfr then I saw his nose bump I was like? Oh so it's natural ASDFIHSLL then I was like mkay he still got his eyes done tho everybodyyy got their eyes done but then I saw that kid pic with a straw and was shocked how big and googly his eyes naturally are. I was lit dumbfounded and reflected on myself like wtf am I actually doing on stan twt😭 I'm so serious because I did all this hating just to be part of the gang, being a follower but he wasn't even a bad dude and we were hating on fake news 🤦‍♀️ I get we young (I'm prob one of your younger anons 16 >.&lt;) but this is straight up incel mental illness & I wanted none of dat so safe to say I dropped them while I was still fresh to kpop because it's really insecurity and projection with themselves and I didn't wanna be apart of that subgroup. I did ur survey too I'm one if the newer ones from July and one of my new zerose moot asked if I like gossip and told me bout u ASDGIJLKDG so now I'm here</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
