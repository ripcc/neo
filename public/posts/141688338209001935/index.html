Hanbin always knows at least a bit of bnd&amp;riize activities while meongddo ?? they don't even try to know about zb1 at all. If talking about schedule all them are busy af but hanbin really made an effort that none of them even think about, idk maybe I'm just too deep with the idea of zb1 get look down by others</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
