Kind of like what a lot of older groups have done and getting together for comebacks less often but often enough so that we don't see as much fan loss as what usually happens for survival groups</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Even then it still wouldn't work it all ends up falling through cuz of greed and bad planning like we'd be better off just getting an anniversary comeback a couple times</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
