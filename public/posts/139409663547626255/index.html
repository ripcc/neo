I'll be fair tho he's not remotely as bad as jiwoong and Gyuvin in terms of dumbass comments or as bad as yujin in terms of sucking up his akgaes and saesaengs but he gets the least criticism for it when it's not the first time he does things like this</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
