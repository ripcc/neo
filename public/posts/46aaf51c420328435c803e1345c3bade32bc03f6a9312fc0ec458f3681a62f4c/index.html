He was like super shy so tbh I didnâ€™t think heâ€™d last long as an idol, like even Psy said he was the shyest person heâ€™d ever met. But he also said the N word but no one ever talks about it because itâ€™s in a small clip during a collage of their survival show LOUD. How you live in Australia for years and still rap the N word in a rap song? In a way itâ€™s good he left for the rest of the members before that controversy blew up blew up because the other members are genuinely cool + Hwi is a genuinely insane producer that Stray Kids sampled one of his songs for â€˜Maniacâ€™.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
