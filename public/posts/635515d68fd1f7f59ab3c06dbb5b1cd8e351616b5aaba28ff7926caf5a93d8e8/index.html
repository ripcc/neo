Anymore so it feels flat and it's not like being good at lip syncings a thing anymore I have faith they'll try to sing live the usual ones who do anyways. AND MAMA REALLY DOES GET WORSE LIKE WOW COLLAB STAGES JUST ARENT A THING ANYMORE EVERYBODY DIEEEEE the separation of everything sucks and the move to do la was just horrid.. but honestly it's also the fact that kpops just dying</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
