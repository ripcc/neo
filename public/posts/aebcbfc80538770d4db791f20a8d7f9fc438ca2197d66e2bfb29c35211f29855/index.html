I was literally thinking “I wonder how the members of zb1 would vote if they could for this election?”. Does any kpop stan actually think their idol would stand for their right to abortion? Does anyone actually think their fave would protect or push for same sex marriage? 8/9 of them are adults who’d have the right to vote. And yes I think those that don’t care about politics are actually bad people because politics and policy directly affects you and others who can’t vote, like kids or some immigrants or others as a whole. Add onto the fact South Korea has an insanely high level of incels and gender relations are horrible there, they’ve likely been socialized with certain toxic beliefs about women (same as all men around the world). Men are just men after all, and being an idol doesn’t erase that or make them a protected class. Just a reminder to keep them at a distance; yeah you can find them hot and like their personality but think critically of their beliefs. Obviously most are kept under a strict leash about political commentary but that doesn’t mean their absence of opinion means they align with your beliefs; the odds are the exact opposite. How many idols have been exposed for being gross sex pests who think woman are just their wombs? It’s insane.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I saw some kpop fans making some stupid tweets like "oh no concerts" and i really couldnt take them seriously at all like not even on some angry shit lmao but i feel like you have to just see kpop as purely an interest something to take the edge off, to kill time, to enjoy, etc. That honestly prevents it from getting too deep and thats kind of its purpose anyways cuz Im not trying to think about the actual moral stances of the men I keep up with that would just kill it entirely like FJDGHNFJDKJGNF IF THATS THE CASE THERES NO POINT OF BEING A FAN i think its good to keep this in mind for sure cuz I do but theres never going to be a protection no matter how many good inferences you can make good reminder tho</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
