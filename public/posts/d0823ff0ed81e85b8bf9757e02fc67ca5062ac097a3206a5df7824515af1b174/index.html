his international fandom is another thing, there I can see many of his fans leaving whether he becomes a soloist or rebeduts in a group because ifans just aren't that loyal compared to cfans but who knows? if yh ships him to c-ent, then I can see him gaining more sea fans since from what I've observed much of c-ent's international fandom is made up of sea fans but he'd lose a lot if not all of his kpop ifans for sure. the best case scenario would be to find a balance between c-ent and kpop.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
