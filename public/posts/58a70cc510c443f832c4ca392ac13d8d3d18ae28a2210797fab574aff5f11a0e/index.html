Solo is doing really well rn and yea skz got the most intl success rn and their cult fanbase probably brings in a crazyyyyyy amount of revenue. thank u like nmixx have so many viral potential moments but nobody cares ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ even before the scandal happened nobody was gagging at the fact that they're talented it's because they've been talented from the start and they weren't received well so it doesn't change anything for them the way baemon got attention for vocals around the time of lsfms peak hate nmixx only got a little and they're miles better</p></div></section></article></main><script type=module src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js></script><script>window.twttr&&(console.log("twitter load"),window.twttr.widgets.load())</script></body></html>
