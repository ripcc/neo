(idk what other word to use cuz this is definitely not that serious to say this lol) because they're majority new kpop fans so it didn't translate well. but they're right when you put it into perspective zbwon are technically the produce bg after wannaone which is so crazy to think about THEY REVIVED SOMETHING IN KPOP THAT WE HAVENT SEEN IN AGES AND THEY MAKE THE MOST SAY THATTTTTTTT everyone's been taking a piece of their nachos and we're gonna see big4 trying their method once they're gone</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/146292812944727384 class=replyLink>/+r/146292812944727384</a>wait about this they did revive and a lot of people who were not even into kpop were into that i have some oomfs who's first group was zb1 most of them are from anitwt they did good, me personally i was an exol left kpop and zb1 got it back for me but im tired im literally leaving kpop after zb1 ends imma stay looking out for kingwook tho</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
