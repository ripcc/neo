Cnetz hate it when their reputation is ruined or if it makes Chinese people look bad and no matter how desperate he was so was everyone else so he just came off extremely selfish and again like I said ruined the group atmosphere & I'm sorry but no amount of evil editing can edit the visibly annoyed and frustrated faces his group had with him</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
