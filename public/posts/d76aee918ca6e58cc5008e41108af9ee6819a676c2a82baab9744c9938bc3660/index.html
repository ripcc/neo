It would save everyone a lot of turmoil
It happened with his vague comment during the 8star fanwar, when he went to Jeju, or when he made that try being an idol comment...This is the first time I see him actually apologising for something but again, for what? You can argue it's a bit shameful and impossible to say I apologise for visiting a saesaeng exhibition it wasn't my choice but what worth is there in his non apologies?? He is too cowardly to address quite literally anything heads on and it has caused many issues and fanwars since the beginning of the group and it's becoming more and more annoying, he's pushing 30 he can talk clearly</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
