It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs only 1 or 2 zb1 members and the gap would be too big to be understandable like it would just make more sense to keep those 6.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I can see them adding two trainees and dropping yunseo tbh like he's not a gag and at least seungeon is needed. This makes me think of junhyeons group I forgot the name but he's no longer the most popular member the new kid beat everyone out cuz he's a visual and a singer so if they have someone like that it wouldn't be too bad</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/141923048222841557 class=replyLink>/+r/141923048222841557</a>I'm literally begging them to drop yunseo let's be fr need a real main dancer neither yujin nor hao are good enough for that ughhh I'm just afraid they're keeping him because of the nayeon's cousin nepotism like even brian was more popular and liked by kfans</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
