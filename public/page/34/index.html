Like queef said that’s too unprofessional and we all know they play it up for rps fans but even they they still gotta think about what they say. However I will say as a Chinese speaker that the phrase has many meaning and after listening to the context I seriously doubt he meant it in the inappropriate context at all and more of “hanbin someone who has a lot of knowledge, knows a lot about certain things” but not in the sexual context. In that instance the op who reposted all the sexual connotations and mislead other rps fans was the main person doing damage to both of them.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
