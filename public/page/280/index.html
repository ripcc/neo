There is no growth at all, reflecting they can't attract new fans that much. Even the poca market in korea is not massive anymore.

From the video what actually happened was the context of Gunwook saying what kind of leader hanbin is and he was saying he‚Äôs really nice basically and gave this story as an example. Ricky was sick and was wearing padding for the whole rehearsal but he didn‚Äôt tell anyone so no one knew he was sick, gw said if it were him he probably would have said take the padding off and come practice, he said hanbin never got mad/ annoyed tho and instead playfully told Ricky they they should practice together and gw said that him realise how thoughtful hb is. Hb then gave Ricky the silence card because he thought he was about to make an excuse for smth and wanted gw to continue with the story. Now some fans have made a whole random narrative to it saying hb is a bully and scolded rk (even tho gw explicitly said he never scolded/ got mad at him), calling him a bad leader for not noticing rk had a cold (like rk isn‚Äôt a grown man who could have just said) and mad about the silence card saying he didn‚Äôt get to defend himself (which idg why he would need to he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong they are just talking about that incident) his c fans made some whole new narrative saying hb silenced him so he wouldn‚Äôt expose his bullying. Some of them are saying he is as bad because he said he would have told him to take it of and that he is an enablerüò≠like these people aren‚Äôt real. /+r/152840847954762417</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
