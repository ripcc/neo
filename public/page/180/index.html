Loved their music, I was a fan of Yunjin, chaewon was gorgeous and I was a fan of Sakura since produce 48. But the Garam situation happened and the one TikTok they posted (yk THAT one like the day after she got kicked of them hugging and the song saying something about family) and it screamed to me mean girl. I didn’t stop stanning, like I loved the music, but it stayed in the back of my mind as a slight ick. As time passed on I realized Yunjin “changing” the idol world by a generic guitar song about “not being a doll :(“ was so cringe and made it so apparent they were fake, or at least superficial. All for being “fearless” and apparently “pro-woman” that the members did that TikTok, made comments 0T5 right after Garam was kicked, etc. Fake, superficial, yuck. Why don’t you actually change the world by donating the funds from your generic self-written song or a portion of revenue from a group comeback? Or be confident about not fitting the beauty standards and navigate the kpop world like that instead of getting a jaw shave and nose job #2? Their concept was in constant contrast to how manufactured and performative they were. At least other groups are clear about being there just to get a check. Then the Sakura thing happened and made me realize that wow they really were not great singers and that I hated Eunchae’s tone. The inability to get better frustrated me. Smart came out and I stopped, like what in the tyla cosplay was that??? Coachella left me shocked. I don’t like any of them (besides maybe chaewon) on what they’ve displayed personality and talent wise but then again she was rigged from her rich af family with corporate ties into izone. Crazy was good but then again too their company has IDF fund ties. But yeah, that’s my journey with LSF 😭 sometimes I remember how big of a fan I was of Sakura in 2018 and watch some of her stages and get more disappointed at the lack of vocal progression in the past 10+ years she’s been an idol</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Like you’re thanking the dude that directed internal reports of just about every other group there that contain slurs, sasaeng information, rumors, mean af comments, etc. that they for sure know about. You’re thanking essentially their bullies right in front of them. This isn’t even a pro-new jeans thing cuz I think it’s a bit cringe when they thank min hee jin too, but like it’s a whole different level of weird when you have the direct victims of him spanning basically the whole industry and there you are, ass kissing him on stage in front of their faces.
