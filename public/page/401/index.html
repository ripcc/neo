So PocketDol is now defaming the BAE 173 guy that made it into CYE (legit released a statement today basically accusing him of not being faithful to BAE 173 and not doing his activities, tldr: saying he’s irresponsible and a shitty worker and they also said he wasn’t keeping promises with BAE 173’s fandom) and the other trainee from PocketDol, Kenshin, his dad posted on Instagram a picture of 11:11 (Angel numbers?) captioning it that everyone should pray together that the whole group can debut as one. The Project 7 producers also came out saying that all companies knew (and possibly signed off maybe?) before they sent everyone to the show that no trainee that would win would be allowed to cross promote. Parents are now hopping into the drama and PocketDol has started defaming their own artists. So, to sum it up, we got an abusive company trying to force cross promotion, holding another trainee from the same company that made it in as hostage, several legal questions regarding contract law, a Hitler quote, company defamation towards their own artists, desperate parents, and more 😭</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

JJ from HYBE’s Trainee A group or whatever is now a trainee at SM, and there are a lot of rumors about Garam being in SM now. Do I think the Garam one is true? Idk, maybe 50/50, but it’d be amazing if it was true. Imagine she redebuts and her group is more popular than Le Sserafim? And she doesn’t have to worry about the not being able to sing accusations because she can actually sing and they’re from SM? We’ve seen SM do this in the past where they take an idol with huge controversies but stay with them and let them redebut (Lucas, pretty soon Seunghan). I wouldn’t be surprised if Garam is next. I’d cackle so fucking hard. JJ is also like a competitive dancer in like actual international dance competitions too and is super good. Aespa was arguably the biggest girl group last year, and NCT Dream is super popular in Korea. HYBE public enemy #1 New Jeans is basically royalty in Japan and now they don’t have easy access to them anymore.
