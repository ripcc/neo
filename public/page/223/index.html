South Korean’s leader is something akin to Andrew Tate. That’s going to sound ridiculous but he’s very misogynistic, pushes for traditional family values, and is staunchly against anything progressive. He’s been deteriorating the safeguard mechanisms for democracy in South Korea since he was elected. 2. A lot of political scientist expected South Korea to get to this point. Even outside the messed up gender dynamic and insane hatred, a few months back, during a progressive protest, a progressive politician stepped in front of the police to stop them from beating up the protestors. Instead, the police began attacking him. That’s a bad sign when military or police feel comfortable enough attacking a known progressive politician when he wasn’t attacking them whatsoever. 3. Now, what to expect? South Korea has paused soldiers from being released from their service. I fully expect them to forcibly draft more men if they need it. Forced conscriptions. No one is safe, ranging from doctors to news anchors to kpop idols - if things get worse (and they are looking like it) - and if big protests happen, they will be drafted. Anyone on a work visa for non essential jobs might be kicked out or put under diplomatic protection, including idols. The only thing that might prevent all this - and yes I’m being fr - is American pressure or international sanctions on their stuff, which is also unlikely considering their oligarchies and chaebol families and technological essentials. It’s going to be a very turbulent time for South Korea. Keep in mind, although kpop does have a significant positive impact on gdp, it’s a luxury to have. Especially since it’s been more westernized and can be interpreted as informing the youth of western culture - things the leader is against.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I know people like to complain because wheein left but if you really looked into it (had to do me research because ill cry if hanbin goes back to a booty company) when she joined the l1ve Ravi was the ceo and all her fans loved it and the promotion. I actually don’t think there was any complaints. The issues came when Ravi went to the military and some guy call jihyun stepped in as ceo and apparently he was bad at managing and promoting her. But Ravi comes back mid 2025 and will be ceo again (no he never went to jail and he’s not going to 😭 ) so hanbin got lucky there as he will only have the ‘better’ ceo as ceo. Also the management team love him there and quite frankly they don’t have any idols right now so if they wanted mattwook to join or even hanbin to stay (he might get offers elsewhere) they could negotiate some extremely favourable terms for themselves. Also the company is well connected, the managers are all people who have worked in the industry for years and are well connected e.g the manager everyone likes to mentioned worked at yg then jelly fish then cube and then the l1ve. /+r/f1982912aa</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I'm an allin and a solo allin and most of my moots are asians. I'd say Hao, Hanbin and Yujin are all more popular among us asians. It is just the type of face and visuals most of us prefer. Even when I show zb1 to my friends, they all like these three too. And I see very few allins everytime zb1 go to Europe or america. Even we allins call him nugu in the europe sometimes and worry about him not getting cheers. He may be popular among europeans but I feel like members like gyuvin, ricky, gunwook would be more liked by them. If he is liked there then it's good.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
