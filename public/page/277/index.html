Please he is not pchat banned... and when u say that to them they're like 'oh yeah? rmb when u guys were crashing out when the group got banned for a week? we had to deal with this ban since nov 2023 so don't talk' and I'm like umm yeah because a plane full of ppl died and the other ban was cause the fucking president was getting impeach you dumb fucks, so you're saying whatever ricky did to get 'banned' since nov 2023 was worst then those two combined???????? Him not being socially active isn't even a bad thing but they made it into a bad thing because they were comparing him to the members after preaching about loving him for being different and not like other idols.
