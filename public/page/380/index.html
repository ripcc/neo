Like ofc something like 2 seconds (figuratively) in a 3min song is crazy but the genuine crash out I watch some people have in this fandom over their bias not having the most when they are consistently at the top is outstanding to me. This isn’t just about todays issue in particular but I always think about this, especially when zerose start to go on coke rants about X deserves more lines, ok then who do you propose we take lines away from them. Because lines aren’t limitless, some people will get less and some people will get more but I’m not about to throw a pity party for someone who consistently gets more when the whole fandom starts tweaking out and insinuating any of the others should have had less.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

People said sunwoo and hyunjae sfs are the worst of all.
