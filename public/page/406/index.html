In our case the unique thing is once they disband it will become really clear whose peoples number 1 was because that’s ultimately the one they will keep up with more. Until then there will always be rosins saying haobinist don’t care about hao and allins saying haobinist don’t care about hanbin. Fact of the matter is only a few will truly care about both equally and some will care more for hao and some more for hanbin and they can’t control or change that or even get them to drop the ship to focus on their fave like they want because that’s not and never been how shipping works. /+r/135785348893726748</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
