In this instance they can’t say shit about his dance because they know he’s an amazing dancer (even if they think their fave is better) his vocals are washing most of their group, he’s good looking, he’s controversy free. So they go for the typical homophobic or fatphobic comments. Homophobia is shitty as hell anyway but the fatphobic ones trip me up because hb thin as hell so what are they even talking about 😭</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
