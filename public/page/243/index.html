The sheer obsession gwk has w mtt is undeniable and it's rlly smth deeper than just reg friendship it's funny to see how it actually pisses his gf fans off 😭😭 I have a bunch of friends who have a real hatred for the duo and the amt of crash outs they have cuz it's unavoidable and very driven is so funny to me they be cussing gwk out lmaoooo. and yes even tho mtt has clout agendas and gets on my nerves he too has an equal obsession it just presents differently. When they talk about living with/next to each other when they're older I really believe them they're each others special person and their bond transcends the group UGH YOU GOT ME TOO LIT THEY JUST NEED TO OPEN THEIR HEARTS AND DISCOVER THE TRUTH THAT I KNOW THAT THEY DONT AND MAKE PILGRIMAGE TO CANADAWEDDINGHALL</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>enough with together or not together THIS TALK RUINS THE VIBE i love mattwook sm brooooo and yes their relationship is desper the way they're the most comfortable with each other gunwook looks at him with stars in his eyes and he's so damn big like when he's all over matt 😭😭🤌💗 i saw their videos and they just too lovey mannn im so happy i love it idc if it's clout or being pushed you can always see genuineness and sincerity in ppl's eyes and behavior like all this aside they love each other's company, they voth love skinship and im sure they've talked a lotttt and brought them closer like ugh ts gets me lit too I JUST LOVE THEM MAN pls stay together i dont care how 😭💔 matthew is purest of hearts he's so real when he likes someone and always will be true and gunwook is similar hes more caring and HE'S YOUNG AND WORLD IS HIS OYESTER WHATEVER jskskskksks MATTPARKZ FOR LAIFEEE /+r/159536966571087428</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Or whatever the fuck for each other I wanted to dieeeeeeeeee. May nothing separate them.. it feels like the most natural thing ever they're always tgthr whether it's on or off cam they're built off deep friendship I like that it was built off their interests and personalities more than proximity and time so theyll have a strong road ahead post disbandment so I'm happy MATTWOOK DEADASS SAVED MY LIFE</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><a class=index href=/posts/2025/03/16/159545571093468053/>#12896

The sheer obsession gwk has w mtt is undeniable and it's rlly smth deeper than just reg friendship it's funny to see how it actually pisses his gf fans off 😭😭 I have a bunch of friends who have a real hatred for the duo and the amt of crash outs they have cuz it's unavoidable and very driven is so funny to me they be cussing gwk out lmaoooo. and yes even tho mtt has clout agendas and gets on my nerves he too has an equal obsession it just presents differently. When they talk about living with/next to each other when they're older I really believe them they're each others special person and their bond transcends the group UGH YOU GOT ME TOO LIT THEY JUST NEED TO OPEN THEIR HEARTS AND DISCOVER THE TRUTH THAT I KNOW THAT THEY DONT AND MAKE PILGRIMAGE TO CANADAWEDDINGHALL</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><a class=index href=/posts/2025/03/16/159533233523086666/>#12879
