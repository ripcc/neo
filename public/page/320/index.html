tier 1 guaranteed in a group: yujin (guaranteed yuehua but could be poached, not sure how likely that is though) > gyuvin (guaranteed yuehua) > taerae (guaranteed wakeone)
tier 2 likelier to debut in a group than do other ent stuff: ricky (should be guaranteed yuehua but i can see him leaving there’ll probably be rumors about his contract later this year if there aren’t any yet) > hao (only this high because yuehua but if he’s really leaving he’s going down to tier 3) > gunwook (would be in tier 1 but i’m putting him here because idk if he’ll go the1ive/wakeone/jellyfish) > matthew (a little similar to gunwook but lower because of age)
tier 3 likelier to do other ent stuff: hanbin (soloist unless mattparkz the1ive rumors are true) > jiwoong (almost certain he’s not doing a group again)</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
