Tbh anon I don’t think it’s a big deal. It’s all personal preference at the end of the day and imo he said he got his arm tattoo with his dad and im p sure there was a story for the other one. Anyway what I mean to say is both had a significance to him whereas most people don’t view piercings the same way and simply get them for the look. So if he doesn’t feel the need to get them for the looks there nothing weird about that and it’s not like he’s going on a coke rant everyday about piercings being bad or whatever he simply stated the one time that they aren’t for him.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
