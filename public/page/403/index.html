Why are they so "dumb" to risk it all? Because breaking rules is sexy. Breaking dumb rules is a sign of a confident, skeptical, risk-taking character. One would imagine that an art/entertainment field would attract a lot of these characters (much of idoldom is more craftsmanship/influencer shit than art, but it still involves creativity, adaptibility, interpretation, etc.). The risk itself is the reward. One cannot ascend to great heights, entertain the masses, become a brand, or inflict themselves on the world without risk. Being an idol isnt all about being "smart", how about passionate, sensual, and alive? Aren't those incredibly vital attributes to have as an entertainer? Is conveyed passion not the basis of idol-specific parasociality? You think the idols who are heartfelt, confident, sexy, and expressive learned to be that way by obediently adhering to rules, mechanically practicing body rolls 8 hours a day, and thinking about fan 24/7? ðŸ¤” Hell no. I guarantee the best, most passionate, driven idols and careerists in general got to be that way by breaking some rules (and probably some hearts, maybe their own), yet kpop fans so desperately keep trying to stamp these ultimately productive behaviors out of them, failing (more like not caring) to see how detrimental attempting to do so is to ALL idols.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And fan scrutiny toward them is inevitable, it's just part of the fandom/entertainment ecosystem. But to outright condone the "hyper scrutiny" of idols bc they got big money (only 5% get it from their careers) and are worshipped by fans (most of which is transactional and controlling in nature) is not only incredibly perverse and frankly vengeful, but also fucking dumb bc hyper scrutiny and paranoid near-constant surveillance directly worsens their collective quality. It's just so bizarre to want and expect idol-aspiring teens to have the forethought and wherewithal to resist the temptation of forbidden romance and casual flings/hookups, a temptation that is literally artificially CREATED by the sexually repressive idol training environment itself. They dont all just come in with it. And the idea that giving in and getting caught indicates they aren't serious about their career is just so dumb and unempathetic I have to imagine it's coming from people who raise their hands in class to remind the teacher there was homework or otherwise have such intense aversion to sex that they cannot conceive of normal sexual drives in young adults (assumedly their peers. please tell me these arent the thoughts of people 21+). I mean the only reason this unofficial rule is even imposed and discussed within kpop is bc most kpop fans are control freaks, tattletales, simple-minded misanthropes, or low libidinal escapists, too many of whom genuinely think giving up romantic/social life for the sake of a career is a mature sign of dedication, pragmatism, and passion for work rather than a cope for their inability to multitask, social ineptitude, fear of intimacy, or lack of passion for/direction in life beyond work.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

And I really meant this in the crazier scenarios just because an idol hasnt been exposed doesnt mean theyve dated and drank and smoked and just behaved like a teenager but imo with seunghan it was a lot worse than just that a lot of people try to chalk it up that way but everything that id seen about him and even eunseok soured them a bit but i dont hate them. og anons ask was harsh but i was thinking of seunghan and the recent male idol exposÃ©s</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><a class=index href=/posts/25ba231d3dfdd21b0f0dd2f77a6bd6f6e59572dc4a0861f577e350ce496d5a1b/>#1310

This is just my assumptions he probably got his chin implant when he got into yuehua china? Dunno but the chin implant was horrendous and unnaturally pointy that in June-ish he prob got jaw fillers around the chin implant to make that area fuller, blend the obvious implant line so that the chin implant isn't so obvious now that there's volume on the side. And it's probably why his face looks extra weird when he's bloated because filler is hydrophilic.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
