So like it’s not the same as finding out exactly who sent those asks and blaming them, what they point in starting a fight over something anonymous it’s not like the person will ever feel the direct repercussions of it. I’m just shocked at how nasty and violent and graphic those death threats get especially when I’ve seen a couple in different cc say hb should be put in gaza to be bombed like at that point I don’t even know how people can even adress or respond to that because it really does go beyond mental illness when you use the genocide of a whole race of people to wish death on someone whose never done anything</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
