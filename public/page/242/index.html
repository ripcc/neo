I think it's confusing to people in countries that don't have it but it's an alternate way to get a bachelors. that's probably why he's taking extra language classes too like it's helpful to his idol career but foreign language is also a subject on the national exam /+r/159522748073464813</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Idc if I sound crazy I think they're friends thatve crossed the line with each other I don't think they're tgthr because they're not obviously (will they ever be tgthr 😂🤔 also probably no) but.. they're smth more trust me they just don't know it. The sheer obsession gwk has w mtt is undeniable and it's rlly smth deeper than just reg friendship it's funny to see how it actually pisses his gf fans off 😭😭 I have a bunch of friends who have a real hatred for the duo and the amt of crash outs they have cuz it's unavoidable and very driven is so funny to me they be cussing gwk out lmaoooo. and yes even tho mtt has clout agendas and gets on my nerves he too has an equal obsession it just presents differently. When they talk about living with/next to each other when they're older I really believe them they're each others special person and their bond transcends the group UGH YOU GOT ME TOO LIT THEY JUST NEED TO OPEN THEIR HEARTS AND DISCOVER THE TRUTH THAT I KNOW THAT THEY DONT AND MAKE PILGRIMAGE TO CANADAWEDDINGHALL</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>I agree with all this sis.. and i think outside people are too quick to dismiss them as bait when they're very close friends before anything else but if we wanna look at them at a deeper level.. I think people always think of crossing boundaries as friends as doing something physical when it can be emotional just as easily. both gunwook and matt are flirty as a joke with members mtt more so but if u know gunwook at all u KNOW everything he feels shows on his face and he genuinely gets so nervous and shaky sometimes when something matthew related is happening its kinda funny like usually he'll be calling members jagiya and flirting with them but when matthew takes it too far he cant even maintain eye contact like ouuu i think there's a big possibility that at one point one of them or both of them realise their jokes were getting way out of friend territory and subconsciously or even consciously (if it's conscious I don't think it's ever getting spoken out loud and getting buried in their heads tbh) that one of them might've slightly caught "non friend" feelings OK I GENUINELY SOUND SCHIZO AFFFFFFF /+r/159536966571087428</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

<small>2025-03-16 06:31:36</small></header><p>Let me be brief... i loveeeeee their relationship so much im close to throwing up sometimes. Idc if I sound crazy I think they're friends thatve crossed the line with each other I don't think they're tgthr because they're not obviously (will they ever be tgthr 😂🤔 also probably no) but.. they're smth more trust me they just don't know it. The sheer obsession gwk has w mtt is undeniable and it's rlly smth deeper than just reg friendship it's funny to see how it actually pisses his gf fans off 😭😭 I have a bunch of friends who have a real hatred for the duo and the amt of crash outs they have cuz it's unavoidable and very driven is so funny to me they be cussing gwk out lmaoooo. and yes even tho mtt has clout agendas and gets on my nerves he too has an equal obsession it just presents differently. When they talk about living with/next to each other when they're older I really believe them they're each others special person and their bond transcends the group UGH YOU GOT ME TOO LIT THEY JUST NEED TO OPEN THEIR HEARTS AND DISCOVER THE TRUTH THAT I KNOW THAT THEY DONT AND MAKE PILGRIMAGE TO CANADAWEDDINGHALL</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p>woa you don't play ab mattwook gwk gf stans kill me 😭😭 they're losing so bad /+r/159536966571087428</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
