JJ from HYBE’s Trainee A group or whatever is now a trainee at SM, and there are a lot of rumors about Garam being in SM now. Do I think the Garam one is true? Idk, maybe 50/50, but it’d be amazing if it was true. Imagine she redebuts and her group is more popular than Le Sserafim? And she doesn’t have to worry about the not being able to sing accusations because she can actually sing and they’re from SM? We’ve seen SM do this in the past where they take an idol with huge controversies but stay with them and let them redebut (Lucas, pretty soon Seunghan). I wouldn’t be surprised if Garam is next. I’d cackle so fucking hard. JJ is also like a competitive dancer in like actual international dance competitions too and is super good. Aespa was arguably the biggest girl group last year, and NCT Dream is super popular in Korea. HYBE public enemy #1 New Jeans is basically royalty in Japan and now they don’t have easy access to them anymore. The enemy of my enemy is my friend type of shit</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

If it’s something like a magazine these things are usually planned in advance and the lack of response would have had them taking back the offer after getting ghosted for so long. Whatever it was they clearly wanted to work with him. Also imo it makes more sense for them to post on twt rather than Weibo, they are trying to get wakeone to respond to emails so you think twt or Weibo is going to be more effecting in getting their attention?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
