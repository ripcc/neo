Let’s be 100% honest, the group just started releasing not that great music, their vocal tones sound like screeching when they try to reach high notes (especially Yeji), and none of them have like super super unique talents. They lost their relevancy and I doubt they’ll ever regain their popularity. If they were any other group under a non-big 4 company no one would be talking about them. And like it’s really odd because the fans they have left swear on their momma the music is good and that it’s all lies, like let’s take a step back and gauge the audience. The music is mid, and even when they were “good” they were copying early Weki Meki. Itzy did fall off.

Her daughter is a Ricky fan and I think she's around 40yo. Another one is an older woman too with her husband (they are so sweet 😭) and a Hanini plushie is hanging on her bag. I want to grow old like them. 😭 I remember during the concert, Jzeroses are posting their kids attending with them. Lots of Hao fans carrying Haninis.
