Let‚Äôs be 100% honest, the group just started releasing not that great music, their vocal tones sound like screeching when they try to reach high notes (especially Yeji), and none of them have like super super unique talents. They lost their relevancy and I doubt they‚Äôll ever regain their popularity. If they were any other group under a non-big 4 company no one would be talking about them. And like it‚Äôs really odd because the fans they have left swear on their momma the music is good and that it‚Äôs all lies, like let‚Äôs take a step back and gauge the audience. The music is mid, and even when they were ‚Äúgood‚Äù they were copying early Weki Meki. Itzy did fall off.
