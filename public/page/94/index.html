tier 1 guaranteed in a group: yujin (guaranteed yuehua but could be poached, not sure how likely that is though) > gyuvin (guaranteed yuehua) > taerae (guaranteed wakeone)
tier 2 likelier to debut in a group than do other ent stuff: ricky (should be guaranteed yuehua but i can see him leaving there’ll probably be rumors about his contract later this year if there aren’t any yet) > hao (only this high because yuehua but if he’s really leaving he’s going down to tier 3) > gunwook (would be in tier 1 but i’m putting him here because idk if he’ll go the1ive/wakeone/jellyfish) > matthew (a little similar to gunwook but lower because of age)
tier 3 likelier to do other ent stuff: hanbin (soloist unless mattparkz the1ive rumors are true) > jiwoong (almost certain he’s not doing a group again)</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

When mnet finds someone they love they will make sure everyone knows it. Their default mcs are somi, bogum and kang daniel. Even when they switched companies. They still kept using KD when he left and sued a CJ-related company. Hanbin is known for being good to staff and that's how you secure future gigs. I also see that with mbc and gyuvin.
