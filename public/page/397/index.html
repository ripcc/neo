It‚Äôs not so much loosing the schedule that‚Äôs the issue this time around it‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been handled and the negative impact that can have for hb because he‚Äôs never had a job in China before and to accept and ghost his first one like this is not grossly unprofessional it people talk and I mean tbh it‚Äôs extremely lucky that even after 2 months they still want to work with him after getting ghosted for so long. /+r/138325565005585289</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
