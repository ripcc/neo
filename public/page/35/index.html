I don't even hate uncle anymore like hes staying whether or not so why waste my energy hating when it leads to nothing but u about to change all that because ur still in so much denial and being dense on purpose atp. and again it wasnt just uncle swearing at his own fan but his action afterwards. crashing out on bubble with these chinese ancient proverbs, shifting blame which got matthew and taerae dragged like he just needed to stfu and take the L.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
