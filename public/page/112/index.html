And compared to IG that is available to everyone, including Koreans and Koreaboos. So going live in Weibo and speaking Korean is a bit weird. Who are you talking to exactly because even your fans don't understand Korean? It's like going to a Chinese restaurant ordering Korean cuisine & as far as I know, foreigners can't just do live streaming in weibo unless they applied.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

There was an era around debut when gpds collectively having trust issue towards those who call F4 as F4 because majority are gw haters but some were trying to hide and delete the trace after the final.

But you have to be consistent enough where your skin starts creating it's own natural oils and at first since you put all that shit on your face when you suddenly take it away ur face gonna over adjust and produce way more oil to compensate and for me I was an oil mess for the first month and broke out a lot because of all the excess oil my face made but then by the second month it was less oily and then the third month I started feeling normal and now I just use moisturizer and eye cream and sunscreen. 3 month of uglyness is worth it imo because I'm pretty much acne free and saved so much money not just on skin care routine but also foundation and concealer since I barely use it now because my skin looks fine without it now I just got some dark circles so i use a bit of concealer when i go somewhere fancy but thats it.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
