I thought he said he likes the pain while being tattooed before so he's ok with getting another one. Anyway, i think, his problem isn't about the ear being naturally sensitive.

There really hasn’t been any update if his dad (it was his father that was sick I believe) has gotten better or not, but since then K-Soul has been on a hiatus for over 5 months and is promoting his solo album (his contract with Fantasy Boys label (PocketDol) allows him to has his own solo album even if it isn’t through them so he isn’t breaking any laws by doing so). His solo isn’t tied to any other big label but rather a small group of people. Odds are he won’t return to Fantasy Boys since lord remembers the last time he was promoted on fantasy boys official and they haven’t had a comeback in forever. The group is sending some of their members to another survival show either way coming up. Initially Fantasy Boys had a somewhat okay following even tho the show was horrendous (I’ve watched over 20 survival shows and it was the worst I’ve ever seen) because it aired on public cable, so it actually had higher ratings than Boys Planet. But I’d say 1/3rd of those that followed the show, even if their faves got in, stopped and quit the group because K Soul got in and because the ranking system made no sense. Also, it’s one thing if he was talented and had his personality, like if he was Adele i feel like most people could ignore how he acts, but his singing is mediocre, he can’t rap, his dance is ok but he can’t make expressions, I think he’s had too much work + botox done. He also hasn’t once released a childhood photo despite the rest of his members doing so, and I believe it’s because someone would research it and find out how old he is and see what work he’s had done. For those that think I’m tripping, look up one of his fancams and look at how he moves his face. It’s somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

If he was a kisser I think he’d be the type to kiss, pull away and give a dummy smile and be proud of his work but then return, he’d be more of an average kisser but proud of himself) Ricky (I feel like he’d be too into angles or aesthetics to actually get down and dirty 😭 he’s probably be thinking “I look hella good in this angle” and make you tilt your head in a super uncomfortable angle to suit him 😭 he got nice lips though) Gyuvin (bro wouldn’t know what he’d be doing but would probably just like doing little pecks and get giddy, he’d be awkward with his long limbs and not know where to put himself or his hands, but it’d be cute and if you’re down to lead and teach he’d be fun)</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
