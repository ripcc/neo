I don't know if it's the combo of his veneers and whatever work he's done on his face, but he can barely move his face properly.

<small>2025-02-02 21:37:54</small></header><p>I WANT IT SOOOO BAD and it also feels like they can really solidify their legacy if they participate in their music like something tangible of their presence ugh lemme not get depressing. but agreeee gwks version was better than the og and its not like his royalty's were gonna be that good like please 🤦‍♀️ I think more than them being evil it's probably inconvenient to have the idols get in the writing room rather than just ordering a song and poof. I feel like a lot of the songs they get are basically perfected demos so the people they work with just whip smth up and send it over... idc gwk is capable of creating one from scratch PLEASE INCLUDE HIM I BEGGGGGGG</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><a class=index href=/posts/144882827912240473/>#10270
