I have noticed that usually those fancams that get more views are usually the ones when the kfans really like the hemeco (hair makeup and outfit) and the dance. there is no co relation to likes and views because the same fans watch the video multiple times because they really like it. It is easy to identify what they like, just by their reaction to a performance. For example if Gunwook had a mr mr fancam, I think it would do pretty good numbers compared to his other fancams, because I know everyone liked his look that day. Hanbin's perfume fancam was the same. And for Hao, I kept seeing his kfans posting his visuals in the beginning of the mr mr performance but the clip is not from the fancam. So it can be because they really liked his look that day. Also this is coming from someone who believes fans aren't going to spend money on their idol's fancam views so it is just my opinion. /+r/143273867748792326</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I also sometimes call idols fat(only male idols, not your gunwook) because I feel insecure about my body (I weigh 48kg) and I'm not actually fat but not thin like winter. So, everytime I see posts like these, it makes me feel bad for other aespa members especially Karina (they are obviously shading her) because I feel like I relate to them. I learnt from the quotes that karina fans also shade winter by calling her skeleton but still it doesn't feel as personal as this one because I don't relate to it at all.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
