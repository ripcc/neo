It makes me wonder if naturally genuinely smart idol wannabes have a harder time adjusting to becoming an idol than their less intelligent counterparts? And if being an idol is a field well adjusted artists with higher cognitive abilities naturally are dissuaded from due to the fact your odds of actually succeeding as an idol are slim and you can’t ever be 100% authentic? Remembering the lack of formal education helps me not be delulu too, cuz while I can’t sing I can practically guarantee no one in zb1 knows more about housing policy and international relations than I do and that takes me back to reality. Like yes I love most of them but all they really are are singers and dancers and that’s just their career; they aren’t inherently more important than a graduate student at college pursuing their masters degree. They’re just normal peeps.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
