Why are they so "dumb" to risk it all? Because breaking rules is sexy. Breaking dumb rules is a sign of a confident, skeptical, risk-taking character. One would imagine that an art/entertainment field would attract a lot of these characters (much of idoldom is more craftsmanship/influencer shit than art, but it still involves creativity, adaptibility, interpretation, etc.). The risk itself is the reward. One cannot ascend to great heights, entertain the masses, become a brand, or inflict themselves on the world without risk. Being an idol isnt all about being "smart", how about passionate, sensual, and alive? Aren't those incredibly vital attributes to have as an entertainer? Is conveyed passion not the basis of idol-specific parasociality? You think the idols who are heartfelt, confident, sexy, and expressive learned to be that way by obediently adhering to rules, mechanically practicing body rolls 8 hours a day, and thinking about fan 24/7? ðŸ¤” Hell no. I guarantee the best, most passionate, driven idols and careerists in general got to be that way by breaking some rules (and probably some hearts, maybe their own), yet kpop fans so desperately keep trying to stamp these ultimately productive behaviors out of them, failing (more like not caring) to see how detrimental attempting to do so is to ALL idols.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

While what he did could be viewed as normal (when truly looking at it i still find it kinda weird) its not anything that warranted the hate he got but he specifically showed a lack of caution like wayyy outside of rule breaking especially the spottings he had between hiatus and departure and the spottings he had as an sm rookie AND the alleged stories about his character. Those are less concrete but they painted him as an ass but both asks were fun to read and respond to I hope I didnt just word vomit im not the best w my words sowwy.

Like obviously theyâ€™re going to have a strategy to make the member least liked in a group likable again and to gain some more popularity (using Seungkwan to warm up Joshuaâ€™s perception), whatâ€™s so wrong with that??? Just send them to a few variety shows and make him likable. Another thing is of course theyâ€™re going to keep tabs on their competition, Iâ€™d also be plotting how to make my artist (which Iâ€™d already invested millions into training, procedures, promotions, etc.) into being the most well known. Where I draw the line is like them actively pushing rumors and unwarranted hate (especially the Monsta X Wonho case), but the theoretical part is basic business (without the genuine evil actions, monopolization, company racketeering and media control). I even understand the yaoi ranking tracking, like yaoi sells ðŸ˜­ youâ€™d think haobin would be like as popular as they currently are if they didnâ€™t have the biggest ship to promote each of them last year?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
