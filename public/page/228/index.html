I was in a fandom with a severe akgaes case. When the group exists, those akgaes were so loud, fighting for 'my bias is the most relevant' and keeping the 'my bias sold out/sell goods the most' race. When the group disbands, these akgaes gone like GONE and move on to another idol with nice akgaes field to fight in. They just love those adrenaline rush from fighting and feeding their overinflated ego by thinking their bias 'winning' as their own achievement in life because irl they are losers or unhappy individuals and their bias achievement is the only thing they could have in life. Which is funny because when they logged off, no one care about all that and they are still the same sad, loner loser.
