For some context, generally speaking you don't just abruptly lose ba jobs unless you get into a huge scandal like with the cn govt or taxes and there will be official brand posts saying that the contract was terminated, in usual cases the contracts just end normally and don't get renewed after a certain amount of time (3-6 months is normal for short-term contracts and Olay literally just got announced weeks ago so if any of his endorsements were to not get renewed it would be older ones like tt or mistine first, we would definitely know when this happens since he would no longer be listed under bas when asking customer service and he probably wouldn't have been posted by them for like over half a year). 8stars are projecting because 2 of the8's endorsements did actually not get renewed which is totally normal and happens to every celeb and will certainly be the case with some of Hao's endorsements eventually as well but they're reacting by starting narratives when it hasn't even happened yet. If they want to shit on his market value they should just wait until one of his endorsements actually does expire Sorry for the rant queefðŸ˜­</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
