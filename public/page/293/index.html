I remember in that idol human theatre ? Jw was saying to hb he thinks he’s younger than he is and always hangs out with the younger members, but imo that’s probably why they don’t feel as distant because even though he’s older he still hangs out with them as friends? Plus hao and hanbin are only 1/2 year older than Bbangiz whereas jw is 4 years older and technically from a different generation. If I give a personal example I’m 03 my brother is 98 so a similar age gap but I can still feel a generation gap with him, meanwhile my younger sister is 2010 and I don’t feel one with her because our generations grew up quite similar /+r/151426525634452120</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I wouldn’t like to get Taerae’s affection either. It always seems super performative and he basically begs to be treated special. I do not fuck with his personality. It’s particular in a weird way, sometimes he’s attention seeking and it’s off putting, etc. I like literally all the other members (except jiwoong, he’s genuinely cringy). I know some fans will call me homophobic but it ain’t that. He’s has a very weird personality that I don’t trust. I fuck with the other gays in the group, Hao and Hanbin, even if Hanbin’s personality is 99.9% cookie cutter safe.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
