So when someone like shady ass noyb520 comes and becomes the bridge that connects two different worlds and start cross posting weibo and xhs stuff onto twitter and vice versa we're obv gonna trust them and that their intentions are good but that's how they become so powerful because they get to pick and choose which posts to translate and bring onto twitter. No shit they won't bring any negative chn posts of ricky, or when ris are starting fanwars getting ricky dragged for weeks on cside or when they're cussing out ricky for his makeup, hair, working out etc. with blocks of texts with thousands of likes from ris and because of that noyb created this facade that ris or cris (w.e tf theyre are called) are angels who only love ricky and never have anything negative to say about him and dumbass riyangis fall for that shit because they never see anything negative about ris/ cbar since it's all through noyb. The fact that they're a 'mistreatment' advocate trying to 'save' ricky and calls out wakeone no problem when they lost his in ears or taking taxi when every1 does but when its his cbar who scammed fans and fucked up his mic situation they dont say a single thing, they literally had to nuke his old cbar and create a new cbar cuz of it, a literal civil war happened and we know nothing bout it. Like this is literally propaganda happening right before our eyes and dumbass riyangis are stupid af & the fact that they didnt even rt anything related to the new mic too is killing me 😭😭 what a shady ass hypocrite bitch</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Why do people love to talk about their faves possibly dating another idol when things like this always end up ugly. Gunwook is still young. Yes, he can date in private if he wants but his career should be our utmost priority now. The child has so much potential and we should be focusing all our energy on that and not some forced dating rumor. I already hate the yaoibaiting and then you have to add this baseless dating rumor</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
