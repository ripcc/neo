Ik it's too much to ask idols to consider their personal features before getting the current trendy filler/makeup style but his just dont harmonize with his classically balanced features idk like they take up too much space on his face and draw attention away from his gaze in a bad way. Imo a bit of lip filler only look good if your lips have a natural pouty shape (and a lot of filler almost never looks good) which his dont at all they are naturally so sharp and flat but like that was a charm point for him.

I think the simple answer and anyone whose ever been overweight can probably agree is that even if you lose it you never really lose the mindset of wanting to cover up and that can be for a variety of different reasons but even now I’ve lost weight and work and and I’m quite toned I still can’t wear things like bikinis because it’s a subconscious thing of not letting certain parts of me be shown that I trypically would have covered when I was bigger. I’m not saying that’s 100% him but I don’t think we have to deep everything to surgery when there’s very obvious answers as to why he may not want to especially when you consider his past and even the struggles he seems to still have with his body now /+r/b2b8a3ff36</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
