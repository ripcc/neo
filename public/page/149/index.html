So many western trainees don’t understand/think that they won’t be held to the same strict standards of normal kpop idols. Intense practice? Making you starve? Forcing you to act like someone you aren’t? Yelling at you to do better? Having you practice with some injuries? Until 2am? That’s literally the most fundamental aspects of kpop idol trainee culture. Am I saying it’s morally right? No. It’s clearly fucked up and detrimental and does so much damage. But it’s the real world westerners get into when they want to debut with these kpop company’s, and some of them are ignorant or think that they’ll be treated differently because they aren’t a kpop group. What do they think being an idol is like? Why do you think these companies got so successful to begin with and have such skilled idols? And obviously the company isn’t going to let you produce and release songs the second you debut, what sense would that make? What if your music isn’t good or straight up goes against their artistic strategy to grow your career?? Look, I’m not saying it’s good. I just find it stupid that the western idol wannabes or their parents walk into a lion’s cage and get shocked when, wow, they get bitten. It just reminds me of what Manon said of how she started the Kasteye program thing and didn’t realize the workload was so much but was forced to do better and she did. But, obviously, there are insane limits too. The VCHA girls saying there were hidden cameras in their dorm and in their pantry to track how much they ate - JYPE (to our knowledge) doesn’t even do that shit with their kpop groups. And downplaying suicide attempt is sick af. It’s just that I wish that western (typically non-Asian) trainees wouldn’t be so ignorant/ surprised about the system - that way they also don’t get so surprised when subjected to it.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
