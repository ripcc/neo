I don’t think he’s evil but he constantly says things with no context or reasons (like the accent thing) that just fuels his sf up and makes the other members get lashed. Also I get he’s the center and main vocal but in all honesty if rosins expected every single song to be hao and friends then they should have just stanned a soloist, like another anon said this song was predominantly rap and hao isn’t a rapper at all so of course he wasn’t going to have much lines and yet he still had more than the groups main rapper.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

How do you feel that Matthew's rap is getting more recognition because he was given a good rap part which you think Gunwook can also do just as good or even better? This is a genuine question because I'm a bit sad and i need something to make me feel better. Wookie has a rap part too but i'm curious on how he'll sound doing a slow melodic rap. I used to like Btob's Ilhoon's style which like matt's part which i think wookie will slay. I have nothing against matt but i'm hoping that the only trained rapper in the group would be given rap lines to show his skills like how other groups are doing.anyway, i'll be fine</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
