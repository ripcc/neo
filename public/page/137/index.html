If the MCs and some members hadn't pushed themselves too hard, the atmosphere would have been so bad that it would have been impossible to continue. It's not that they're doing badly because they're rookies, but it's like they were dragged out of a public place against their will. I was looking forward to seeing the members for the first time in a long time, but I was embarrassed the whole time. I think from next time, only the members who want to appear should appear” and then a kgpd qrt then mentioning hanbin and then it just tunred into burner accounts going back and forth and dying off into personal insults. Tbh I’m still not sure what the issue actually was, no one on the I side said anything even the akgaes so I guess it’s died over there now.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I rlly liked Ricky and Matthew's too I already forgot what half the group was wearing so I can't rmbr yjns but the fits weren't too bad with the stage it looked more jarring in the mcountdown video. I'm just wondering if this has a choreo or not I was watching the fancam and I could see gwk dancing but maybe it's not to the full song idk</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><a class=index href=/posts/140900002628327819/>#9275
