Ricky is a pro at attracting passersby, that's how he gets gazillions of likes and goes viral on douyin and xhs all the time. Passersby love his vibe and face card BUT most of them don't care about him enough to become his fans, and if they do, most of them stan him casually. He has devoted / hardcore fans too, but they're not enough. Hao's fans on the other hand are extremely passionate. There are other fandoms in c-ent that are 100000× bigger than them but crosins managed to put hao in the top 10 of the list of the best selling magazines in 24 hours despite everything. The fact that they did that is huge considering the people on the list are famous artists / A listers so for someone like hao, who at that time had zero promotional activities in china, to be on that list is monumental. His fans are willing to go above and beyond to support him and make him famous which is very rare even for rookies in china. The only other rookies in c-ent who have extremely passionate fans and a ginormous fandom (way, WAY bigger than crosins) are the members of the new boy group from TF entertainment but TF ent is a powerhouse in china and the members participated in a survival-esque show similar to what JYP did with Sixteen to create Twice, so their popularity makes sense. But with the exception of them and hao, I don't think any other rookie (key word: rookie) has devoted and passionate c-fandoms willing to empty their wallets and do whatever it takes to support their favs.
What ricky needs is an influx of obsessive fans, for his obsessive fans / manager fans to become the majority or big enough to control the narrative of the fandom and create an environment that encourages fans to be more loyal and invest in ricky's future. He needs a stronger core fandom.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
