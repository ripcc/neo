CC is a bit easier to copy & paste backup than retrospring because the threads it generates automatically includes the first few words of the parent comment so plain copy & paste is enough to keep context if you use the search function to find the parent ask; The linking of threaded asks can be done later for formatting sake, but isn't necessary. The main thing is that you have the text + related thread contexts copied to somewhere else before the site goes down. Compare that to retrospring or this site where because threads are only connected by links and links are useless once the site goes down, you have to manually go through the links while the site is still up to copy context so you can search for the parent ask later</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

We can't trust that this site will remain around and it's easier to backup by hand if you can search for the start of the comment before rather than links that won't work in the future. I was doing a backup of a CC w/ about 3k asks by just copying and pasting text to a plain document and even a few words is enough to differentiate comments to search for the parent comment someone was replying to. Unfortunately I don't know of any easier way because of how CC loads more asks and it's an infinite scroll instead of pages with distinct links</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
