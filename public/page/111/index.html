<small>2024-11-15 23:37:59</small></header><p>......what?? nowhere did I say that anyone getting bombarded with hate deserves it, i said i felt bad for anyone who isnt equipped to deal with it like this because it doesnt stop and it can get worse depending on how you deal with it and nowhere did i say its people within their own community doing it to each other?? if you can scroll this far down you can also see the other stuff cuz I never said that. All i said is that having a public anonymous page is a risk in itself because it is and I was talking about the people who were posting publicly on twitter asking why nobody outside their community cares 😭 Im speaking from my own experience of receiving hate on this caliber and honestly more I dont even wanna go into detail about all that but the only way for it to stop is to stop giving it attention and block out what you can ill extend this advice to anyone but at the end of the day if youre someone who cant handle that itll never get better like?? I’ve had people even go as far as stalking my socials for months on end and literally try to doxx me to the point I've felt unsafe on numerous occasions this level of vitriol actually does exist in places like this its not new sadly so yea sorry if i wasnt shocked by it.. its just the price like i said. And nobody is trying to act like this is normal I'm also from a Muslim country I dont see why I have to explain that, its a fact that literally nothing can be done about this these people have no conscience and dark souls and they do whatever they want its either move on or stay stuck there is no other option other than just forfeiting thats it theres no protections. And the anon specifically said that yes the asks were horrible and that they didnt deserve it but its obviously an attention seeking couple of people sending this and they got exactly what they wanted by this entire conversation starting you either deal or you dont. I dont like how im being made out to sound cruel when this is the reality giving attention festers sure my language isnt soft but theres no way you equated any of what I said to that</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><a class=index href=/posts/2024/10/31/8d9e447dada06f8e3290a0b20605bf9d3bec90873a4a39fa4acd8e783e775c40/>#2554
