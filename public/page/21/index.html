I guess c fans know her but if she’s attending k events im guessing she doesn’t actually do anything aside from being all talk on the internet because no one’s jumped her yet. Speaking of being all talk it reminded me of when she said something about stealing zh juice (from his room service probably) and another ssng who was at the hotel said I saw you and that didn’t happen 😭</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

The original premise is for jaejoong to make friends in the industry which makes more sense when you know his history and being blacklisted. The fun episodes are him reconnecting with old colleagues but it got popular so when younger idols come on it turns into a counseling session lol hanbin is definitely the type he likes though like the sociable extroverted types</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I also like that they got to meet another idol whose had a lot of experience, and idk jaejoong was super nice with them and idk much about him as an idol but I did read about his past with sm and I think he’s someone who’d make a good connection in terms of having dealt with a shitty company and not letting it end you</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I’m just typing this on break.
Hao is very outspoken about his feelings for hanbin. Crazy repos aside he singles Hanbin out every time even if the question is open ended or not about him (I ignore his crazy responses where he smirks lmao cause he obv playin there). Like he’s called Hanbin “my most important person in korea” “he’s the person I’m closest to that’s the biggest difference” “we’re closest so i expect and want more from him” “I couldn’t help but cry to him, I couldn’t cry to anyone else” “真正意义上的初恋” “my strong desire to debut was mostly because of him” only took Hanbin to eat with his mom during a busy schedule. And recently he said “when I’m unhappy, if I see him I feel better. If I don’t see him, I can’t” “only Hanbin controls me. No one else dares. Only he can”
So hao consistently over 2 years has put Hanbin on a pedestal from everyone else. And hao relies on Hanbin emotionally the most (kind of needy in a sense, which we saw when hao was whimpering to Hanbin at the beginning of hbs live).
Hanbin on the other hand talks sweetly about hao but hardly ever puts hao on a pedestal from everyone else. Weirdly enough Hanbin kinda does that with Gyuvin. Recently Hanbin was asked who he can be most honest and selfish with and chose Gyuvin and they’re always together. Hanbin use to call hao his soulmate and would talk about him more but now mainly talks about Gyuvin helping him emotionally. I know Hanbin loves hao but it’s less clear if hao is his closest person emotionally. Whether they’re dating or not is up to ppls perception but to me it’s been made clear that Hanbin is most important/closest to hao but it’s not as certain with Hanbin. Ppl can get upset with that but I’m going based off of words and actions.
Damn this was too long my bad 😭</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2025-03-13 18:26:16</small></header><p>ngl im only replying to this since its rlly long i feel bad but in general i take repos as very surface level so who knows how deep any of this goes the contrast is interesting but it also makes you think ab the overall dynamic in the team zgh isnt as close to anyone as he is w hbn but hbn has larger variety. this not my thing tho so idk</p></div></div></details><section class=Main><div class=Question><header><strong>Anonymous</strong></header><p><a href=https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/158743419588664139 class=replyLink>/+r/158743419588664139</a>Kinda agree with you queef. If you looks at the general scope of the group it’s easy to see zh is closer to hb than any other member and it has always been like that, arguably he only even became close to gv because of hb. Whereas hb has always been close to multiple members of the group, like he’s always been close to mtw, always been close to gv since mentioning hugging him the first time they met on bp, even mentions having long late night talks with gw and seems really close too. It’s not that hb doesn’t value zh as much as zh values hb it’s just hb is a lot obviously closer to more people whereas zh circle is extremely small. Plus like queef said you gotta take these repos with a massive pinch of salt because while I believe they are super close and care for eachother 99% of the repo stuff they say is deffo exaggerated for fs and tbh zh has always been the one to play into fs answers more (regardless of the type of fan) than hb. Like hb does to fs but he’s more reserved about giving away stuff that would be deemed personal info his fs is very much idol surface level fs where zh will just say some crazy stuff 😂</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
