For example you guys are still blaming w1 for his mic (not in ears) when it was his weibo cbars fault who scammed fans and everyone knows that except for you guys because you guys only want to blame w1. So is his mistreatment on valid if it's w1 fault? Where were the #FUCKRICKYSCBAR hashtags? Hmmm I didn't see any. And you riyangis all up riding noyb and ttopaz dick when they knew the real reason all along but never told you guys because they didn't want to ruin chinese ris reputation.... they care more about ris reputation then ricky and kept their mouth shut when they saw yall blame wakeone looking dumb af. It's like you guys pick and choose and add in a bunch of unrelated shit so when passerbys sees it they see all the bullshit and never take it seriously like this instance, Gunwook literally mentioned Ricky yesterday and said his part was his favorite or something yet you guys blatantly ignore it because it doesn't fit your agenda. Like no shit its obvious Ricky is mistreated but you guys claim every. single. thing. as mistreatment and wonder why no one takes you guys seriously.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
