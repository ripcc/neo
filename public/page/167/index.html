I'm just tired of these shippers acting like wonyoung is begging for him especially tiktokers when she isn't because they want her validation so bad yet responsible for so much of her hate.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

To add she not only said wolf but further specified a 'blunt' wolf and then Dex didn't understand what she meant by blunt and he said 'blunt? not as sharp?' (dumb translators thought she said that but it was Dex) and then she clarified no, blunt as in the ears aren't always pointing up. Another Korean thing and this is about personality, wolves are always alert/ tense/ uptight with their ears always up and alert listening to their environment in case they get ambushed but puppies have floppy ears because they're more carefree, fun and easygoing and that's what she meant by 'blunt wolf', wolf appearance but behind close doors, behind the intimidating face has a puppy like personality so basically she saying she likes gap moe and I'm sorry but there aint nothing gap moe about Sunghoon 🤦🏾‍♀️</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

In fact since Yujin became mc they cancelled their own show 11 times in 2024 and out of the 21 times he missed inkigayo in 2024 11 of them were because the show was cancelled, 7 because of tour, 2 because of festivals and other music stages, 1 because of a fan event.

I wouldn’t care if they were just complaining at the company but they always wanna pull hanbin into it like they aren’t different situations. Hanbin has missed mca for group schedules it’s just less likely to happen because who’s booking big schedules for a weekday, it just doesn’t happen. Then they want to go on about how they don’t fly out on Thursday and always Friday but I’m sorry even when mca was cancelled and zb1 was still flying out for tour over winter brokeone was still making them fly out on Friday rather than pay for an extra day in the hotel like they are flying out the day before regardless of hanbin having an mc schedule or not. And the biggest distortion yet is that wakeone is the biggest source of Yujin missing his mc schedules. Like wakeone is shit from the butt but if you look at the list mulbokdans made themselves of when and why he missed mc schedules, aside from some tour dates and award shows most of him missing it came from sbs cancelling inkigayo anyway 😭 Kwave recording 02/06/24 (sbs show inkigayo cancelled ) Kwave broadcast 02/06/24 (sbs show, inkigayo cancelled) Hi touch in Japan 14/15 /07/24 Sbs gayo 21/07/24 (sbs show inkigayo cancelled) Kcon LA 28/07/24 Sbs gayo replay 04/07/24 (sbs show inkigayo cancelled) Summer sonic in Japan 18/04/24 Krazy concert 15/09/24 Seoul tour stop 22/09/24 Singapore tour stop 29/09/24 Bangkok tour stop 06/10/24 Inkigayo Tokyo 13/10/24 (sbs show inkigayo cancelled) Inkigayo Tokyo replay 24/10/25 (sbs show inkigayo cancelled) Jakarta tour stop 27/10/2024 Macau tour stop 03/11/2024 Mama Japan 24/11/2024 Japan tour stop 01/12/2024 Inkigayo cancelled because of political situation 08/12/2024 Kms song festival in Japan 24/12/2024 Inkigayo cancelled for winter break 22/12/2024 Inkigayo cancelled for winter break 29/12/2024 Golden disk awards 05/12/2025 Zb1 filming something in Bangkok 19/02/2025</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
