For hanbins finsta there was a rumor that he posted a photo that was taken on Haos phone. For the main part of my ask it was talking about Haos wc predebut and after he got close to Hanbin. He had a blank pfp and was seemingly a bit aloof with people but after getting close to Hanbin he kept changing his pfp to different cute/baby pics of hb including hbs fav Pokémon. And being all cute and sappy/having cute arguments with Hanbin. And then said “真正意义上的初恋” (true first love/love in the truest form) about Hanbin soon after. Hao posted moments on WeChat for only his friends and family to see about Hanbin and 2 that I cannot share myself. To the akgae solos who hate them, hao also apparently cussed yall out and protected Hanbin. In china, doing such things is never done by friends and is even rare in relationships. Doing so classifies you as a “love brain” (obsessed with love/your partner) the wc lore goes deep so I’ll stop here lmao… but there’s just too much lore on them I can’t keep up /+r/139035719443370511</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Also the way they put on mask and there was no photo session after getting of the car, I feel like they trying ninja-ing their way to Thai but the news is all over the place already so yeah🤷‍♀️ let's see for their next official schedule flight, if they still act the same then there is a possibility that wk1 told them to. Zb1 is so friendly with the reporters compared to some idols that I've watched the departure video before
