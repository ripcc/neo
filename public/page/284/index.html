From the video what actually happened was the context of Gunwook saying what kind of leader hanbin is and he was saying he‚Äôs really nice basically and gave this story as an example. Ricky was sick and was wearing padding for the whole rehearsal but he didn‚Äôt tell anyone so no one knew he was sick, gw said if it were him he probably would have said take the padding off and come practice, he said hanbin never got mad/ annoyed tho and instead playfully told Ricky they they should practice together and gw said that him realise how thoughtful hb is. Hb then gave Ricky the silence card because he thought he was about to make an excuse for smth and wanted gw to continue with the story. Now some fans have made a whole random narrative to it saying hb is a bully and scolded rk (even tho gw explicitly said he never scolded/ got mad at him), calling him a bad leader for not noticing rk had a cold (like rk isn‚Äôt a grown man who could have just said) and mad about the silence card saying he didn‚Äôt get to defend himself (which idg why he would need to he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong they are just talking about that incident) his c fans made some whole new narrative saying hb silenced him so he wouldn‚Äôt expose his bullying. Some of them are saying he is as bad because he said he would have told him to take it of and that he is an enablerüò≠like these people aren‚Äôt real. /+r/152840847954762417</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

While gv he can do things that he currently do. As for hb if he go solo and want to be successful he need to go for acting thats the unspoken rules. I'm not really glazing over ravi he will be discharge mybe after zb1 disbandment and if anything he must be depress as hell cause he need to enlist twice so I dont think he's in his right mind to work on music.

Even with the way duhua talked about zb1 including not her own members makes it clear the company knows the value of having a hand in that group and to be completely honest zb1 is more successful with 4 yhz in it that any group yh has ever produced and they themselves know post disbandment no one is guaranteed success. Like anon said it‚Äôs a way more stable form of income to keep them in the group even if they negotiate for more management rights ect. There is a members whose company I think definitely won‚Äôt resign and that‚Äôs based on what I‚Äôve heard here about their actions but each can make their own judgement on who that is because maybe I‚Äôm perceiving that differently too. Overall I think the group could continue with less members like the article said but if definitely won‚Äôt be with half the yhz gone and it would be fully dependent on who those members are. /+r/152834309139683065</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
