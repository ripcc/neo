I think people always think of crossing boundaries as friends as doing something physical when it can be emotional just as easily. both gunwook and matt are flirty as a joke with members mtt more so but if u know gunwook at all u KNOW everything he feels shows on his face and he genuinely gets so nervous and shaky sometimes when something matthew related is happening its kinda funny like usually he'll be calling members jagiya and flirting with them but when matthew takes it too far he cant even maintain eye contact like ouuu i think there's a big possibility that at one point one of them or both of them realise their jokes were getting way out of friend territory and subconsciously or even consciously (if it's conscious I don't think it's ever getting spoken out loud and getting buried in their heads tbh) that one of them might've slightly caught "non friend" feelings OK I GENUINELY SOUND SCHIZO AFFFFFFF</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
