But it’s one thing to decline or try and find a better date and a completely other to accept the offer but then ghost the organisers especially when they have waited up to two months and are still willing to work with him. It’s not so much loosing the schedule that’s the issue this time around it’s how it’s been handled and the negative impact that can have for hb because he’s never had a job in China before and to accept and ghost his first one like this is not grossly unprofessional it people talk and I mean tbh it’s extremely lucky that even after 2 months they still want to work with him after getting ghosted for so long.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Discussions took place with his fanbases about fan preferences (for what I’m not sure) but since the original accepting of the offer mid November wakeone has not been responding to the organise at all so the job hasn’t been able to progress/ happen. The organiser then reached out to his cbar saying they are still interested in working with him it’s just wakeone isn’t responding. They then talked to the other fanbases as well because I mean nearly 2 months is a crazy time to leave a job hanging especially if you agreed to it and then never do it because preparations and planning would have been made around that job happening and the possibility of it falling through because wakeone can’t respond to emails is a terrible look.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
