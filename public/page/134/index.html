Even without asking or knowing this is as clear as a glass. People might think Aristocatz are whores because of their image but no, Aristocatz are quite funny. They got the look and got em nice body but one is a cutie too awkward and shy to rizz people up he doesn't know what to do, the other one is the classic rich boy who hard to love hard to forget type and hoping for a fairytale-like romance, and the other one flirts but he is not trying to date you that's just him being social butterfly hoping to make others comfortable with him immediately. They are the type of guy who got gf less than the amount of fingers on your hands until they reach their 30s</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
