Look at how new jeans bagging luxury brands just months after debut when they aren't known globally yet. Luxury brands don't get endorsers for sales but new market potential. household brands need someone with recognizable name and face because they need real-time sales. If you're a household brand, you don't get khia to endorse your brand. Hao is probably a regional BA/BS. Olay had Bailu before.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

but if I'm being honest, I don't think wk1 hates them 😭 it's just that whoever manages them is incompetent asf. I do think ricky's lack of socmed presence in their official accounts is weird tho because sometimes the staff will post pictures of every single member but him 😭
but going back to the "wk1 hates yhz" conspiracy, yhz themselves encourage that mentality with the exception of yujin 😭 hao flames and "exposes" wk1 every day, ricky said the company knew he was unhappy and that he wants to be more active on ig and +chat but can't, and gyuvin told a fan who wanted to audition for wk1 to run away and to audition for yuehua instead 😭😭 like, what are their fans supposed to think when their favs say stuff like that?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-10-24 00:55:20</small></header><p>oh i know why people say this but its more the fact that running to make narratives is just inevitable we talked ab it last week how kpop fans cant be normal about the company their artist is under even if there are valid critiques. like i couldve told you the dayyyyy zb1 were formed exactly how things were gonna turn out people alreayd expected mistreatment for hao and ricky because theyre chinese and the nature of the industry so a couple wrong moves would cement their fate in the eyes of fans and ig cuz theyre 2/4 of yhz the narrative reached over everyone. for ricky its the most valid i guess.. even tho its annoying and still majorly illogical because of his lack of schedules but listing what he said on that fancall is bogus to me CUZ HE DONT OPEN HIS PHONENJFEN thats all him sis. for hao i think its more handling issues but hes not close to poverty in the slightest there can be conversation about how the cpromo efforts arent useful to him since hes a survival show idol but im not chatting to nobody who gets crazy and stupid 😂👋 and dont even get me started on yujin and gyuvin their fans are the most annoying because theyre treated the best for whats its worth AND GYUVIN GOES ON WEEKLY COKE RANTS HIS WORDS DONT MEAN NUN HALF THE TIME!!!!! yujin fans are greedy bastards and gyuvin fans cant be shocked that he was shelved because of his string of microscandals but those 2 have it good wow this just got me irked cuz these people shouldnt have the nerve but they do ugh but ur right if u not a free thinker what else are u supposed to do its whatever cuz i dont care to mingle or talk amongst fans like that</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><a class=index href=/posts/c90b32c5b4c8a09c8cd8b2d9414ef4fa57e9471908c5b43bf2f2aa18fd4c6bf3/>#1695
