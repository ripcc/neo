He's had lot of hit dramas and his payment is the highest in skorea among actors since 2014/2015. I said this cause I was a big fan of him and this is not shocking at all. I've been feeling weird about kim soo hyun since I read his weird answer in interview and he apparently dated yoona snsd and they broke up because of his personalities</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
