I think rosins believe he will sign with them and that Duhua will be more involved in his future career than yuehua korea? But I don't see how that'll work when he wants to be a kpop artist. Atp who knows what will happen. I used to believe yuehua kr would redebut yuehuaz as a group but now I'm more inclined to believe Duhua will want Hao to be a soloist. It would be better if they all leave that shithole of a company because the way the korean branch managed all their groups tells me yuehuaz bg would be mistreated and mismanaged until they become inactive like UNIQ. Yuehuaz stans can delude themselves and say their boys are smarter than that and will negotiate good contracts and be the exception but that's just cope. /+r/161008680878431421</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

For the longest time it was more a question of if/when yh would disband them early. They never got more than 60k sales, they canceled multiple stops their last tour, and from what I heard didn't sell out for stops with even sizes of like 2k? They're not popular domestically and internationally don't sell enough to make up for the lack of endorsements The only argument I ever hear about them is that they were "super popular" but the only metrics that could even suggest that are their spotify streams and yt views, which are definitely inflated (especially in their earlier mvs, less so now). I vaguely remember one of their mvs was competing with bts for number of views, which just couldn't have happen without excessive ads or view buying at their popularity level. Don't know about spotify, but regardless they weren't earning enough to overcome the production costs for comebacks to actually get paid. I was never really into them, but I've heard news about their touring and hiatus from reddit, plus I checked on their album sales. This is one of the threads where people are a bit more realistic about their position: https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/14p8b52/everglows_hiatus_doesnt_make_any_sense/ . I thought that groundless optimism about EG's success was limited to reddit and twitter, but I'm surprised that it's also here.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

For the longest time it was more a question of if/when yh would disband them early. They never got more than 60k sales, they canceled multiple stops their last tour, and from what I heard didn't sell out for stops with even sizes of like 2k? They're not popular domestically and internationally don't sell enough to make up for the lack of endorsements The only argument I ever hear about them is that they were "super popular" but the only metrics that could even suggest that are their spotify streams and yt views, which are definitely inflated (especially in their earlier mvs, less so now). I vaguely remember one of their mvs was competing with bts for number of views, which just couldn't have happen without excessive ads or view buying at their popularity level. Don't know about spotify, but regardless they weren't earning enough to overcome the production costs for comebacks to actually get paid. I was never really into them, but I've heard news about their touring and hiatus from reddit, plus I checked on their album sales. This is one of the threads where people are a bit more realistic about their position: https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/14p8b52/everglows_hiatus_doesnt_make_any_sense/ . I thought that groundless optimism about EG's success was limited to reddit and twitter, but I'm surprised that it's also here.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
