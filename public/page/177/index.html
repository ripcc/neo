The driver license pic of him idk 16? in LA to 20 is also a good comparison because everything is the same. People need to hop of his dick üò≠ because the plastic surgery agenda with him is so forced if you actually look at his predebut stuff and screams insecurity. Also people forget he's chinese and a lot of chinese faces are more sculpted so lowkey some racism because in their minds they think asians can only have flat features :S</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Nationality and Outing: His nationality and being outed are weaponized against him or fetishized by the fandom. Frustration with Fandom Narratives False Equivalence: The fandom portrays Zhang Hao‚Äôs struggles as similar to others‚Äô, ignoring the unique and disproportionate challenges he faces. This false equivalence undermines the severity of the issues he endures. Villainization of Rosins: Rosins are villainized for addressing these issues and accused of not caring about others. Their concerns are dismissed as obsessive or toxic instead of being taken seriously. Harmful Behavior in the Community Fetishization: Zhang Hao‚Äôs struggles are fetishized, not empathized with, turning his challenges into a spectacle rather than a call for support. Invasive Actions: The community supports or tolerates invasive behavior toward Zhang Hao while failing to reflect on how harmful and dismissive this is. Deflection and Justification: Instead of addressing their actions, the community justifies their behavior by labeling Rosins as ‚Äúakgaes‚Äù (obsessive solo stans), which dismisses the legitimacy of their concerns. Double Standards Rosins vs. Allins: There is a clear double standard in how issues raised by Rosins and Allins are treated.
Concerns raised by Rosins hold more validity, as they address systemic bias and real harm, yet they are consistently undermined. Call-Out to Specific Individuals Requeefiem‚Äôs Role: You accuse Requeefiem of validating and encouraging problematic community behavior due to their personal biases. Request for Requeefiem to stop supporting harmful actions if they don‚Äôt understand the issues fully. Would you like to elaborate on any specific points or adjust the tone?</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

In our case the unique thing is once they disband it will become really clear whose peoples number 1 was because that‚Äôs ultimately the one they will keep up with more. Until then there will always be rosins saying haobinist don‚Äôt care about hao and allins saying haobinist don‚Äôt care about hanbin. Fact of the matter is only a few will truly care about both equally and some will care more for hao and some more for hanbin and they can‚Äôt control or change that or even get them to drop the ship to focus on their fave like they want because that‚Äôs not and never been how shipping works.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
