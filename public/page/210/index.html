Hold on before you block me-let me explain. It really did stifle a lot of growth and fractured their fandom in half. Obviously zb1 has lost some fans along the way but I’m glad we didn’t lose even more to Riize, who, if the scandals never happened, would be the closest alternative. Now they’re like BND level rookie fame instead of what they could’ve been. And if they were absolutely scandal free - and we dealt with another jiwoong level of scandal, I think they could’ve overtaken us. I am thankful to really believe zb1 will go out as the top (sales wise) group in 5th Gen. They broke so many awards, and they’ll have a long legacy as the ones to open up 5th Gen. Also, all album sales in kpop are trending down, so people dragging their sales not being as high as in bloom are delusional. Some groups still might grow but 2020-early 2023 had inflated numbers due to covid and across the industry, even with the top groups, you’ve seen a gradual decline in album sales and engagement to around 2018/19 levels. Now I’m having fun imagining and predicting what will happen with each member. It feels like kpop fantasy football</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-12-18 12:10:11</small></header><p>WHY WOULD I BLOCK YOU 😭???? But... no they're not tbh like riice are still wayyyy bigger than poond domestically and internationally like it's not even close. And Snghans scandal didn't do a damn thing for zbwon it made shit worse and just heightened everything. I think we would've got maybe a fraction less of the hate if jwgs scandal wasn't after snghan leaving and coming back and leaving. it brought attention and pity on riize that would never ever be extended to zbwon and domestically they still win the only thing we got was their intl fandom being destroyed. They're a perm sm group tho it'll be back LOL</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><a class=index href=/posts/2cb99915770d75173a1960a82bebc8048b469fbb6104ceb108a70765e6fd1f7f/>#7113

But I do like kpop reactors that are actually honest about the music, production, mixing, etc. I also love when they aren't only focused on the visuals (like reactors who make a music video reaction only about an idol's abs instead of focusing even partly on the music). For this reason, I'm a fan of ReacttotheK (they are the nicest out of this list) but I also like Koko3op and kpx. If the music is ass or their vocals don't sound good, Koko3op and kpx will call it out and it's so refreshing. The fragility so many fans have towards music critiques is maddening so it's nice to see people actually honest. I also think (even if the reactors have had controversies or whatever) it's nice to see an outside perspective of the music. Like, alright, you right, maybe Johnny's lines in this nct song does distract from the flow of the music, etc. And maybe the production of the song is outdated and the synths sound cheap and detract from the momentum or intention.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Like some of the people calling him that genuinely didnt feel underhanded at all but were taken badly by people they werent friends with, as is the usual course of social media. With that being said, this made me realize that lots of fans either werent present for or just forgot/dont care about how people used to tag him as that in a negative way back during bp and so while gpds can be really tender sissies over all the wrong things, this one kinda makes sense to be sensitive over since it was definitely said more negatively in recent history. Personally the only thing im a bit irked about is how he gets called stuff like that way more than members who actually watched the fight or are just as boyish as he is and we all know its bc of looks and fans' goldfish memory. (Oh and also how this inevitably turns into a "you guys dont know him at all like i do" dumb parasocial war when the truth is he's multifaceted and duality of masculine/feminine exists in everyone but especially demonstrably him js.)</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

1 yujin he dates for dating anyone who is pretty like for 1-2 weeks

4 gyuvin no smoke, no drinking, pretty, touchy, rich highest
1.hanbin once he said he'd date himself so I think he has the same requirements as for himself
2.ricky he has a hard time opening up to people + he's tall, rich, handsome
3.hao he's pretty, smart, popular, rich, loves being spoiled and he's also a LEO

He’d be loyal af but have high expectations of you and a high af sex drive. I think with him he’d be loyal based off of principle and take pride in it. But I do get the sense he’d want to fuck a lot and also hold you and your accomplishments to a higher standard (but also support and encourage you, but there would def still be pressure). So, not a cheater, but if you’re insecure he’d be a hard partner to be with because he’d try to push you above it and he’d be hit on a lot due to how eager to please he is in all aspects of his life. I can see Jiwoong and Hao cheating tho (Jiwoong just because he dgaf and Hao because he’d get lost in the moment but feel bad about it after). Taerae could def be a swinger so not a cheater but multiple partners.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
