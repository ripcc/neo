How do you feel that Matthew's rap is getting more recognition because he was given a good rap part which you think Gunwook can also do just as good or even better? This is a genuine question because I'm a bit sad and i need something to make me feel better. Wookie has a rap part too but i'm curious on how he'll sound doing a slow melodic rap. I used to like Btob's Ilhoon's style which like matt's part which i think wookie will slay. I have nothing against matt but i'm hoping that the only trained rapper in the group would be given rap lines to show his skills like how other groups are doing.anyway, i'll be fine</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
