I was literally thinking “I wonder how the members of zb1 would vote if they could for this election?”. Does any kpop stan actually think their idol would stand for their right to abortion? Does anyone actually think their fave would protect or push for same sex marriage? 8/9 of them are adults who’d have the right to vote. And yes I think those that don’t care about politics are actually bad people because politics and policy directly affects you and others who can’t vote, like kids or some immigrants or others as a whole. Add onto the fact South Korea has an insanely high level of incels and gender relations are horrible there, they’ve likely been socialized with certain toxic beliefs about women (same as all men around the world). Men are just men after all, and being an idol doesn’t erase that or make them a protected class. Just a reminder to keep them at a distance; yeah you can find them hot and like their personality but think critically of their beliefs. Obviously most are kept under a strict leash about political commentary but that doesn’t mean their absence of opinion means they align with your beliefs; the odds are the exact opposite. How many idols have been exposed for being gross sex pests who think woman are just their wombs? It’s insane.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I've only seen clips of some of these shows and they are boring af, making some really unrealistic drama out of no where. Mnet are snakes but they are snakes that can actually tell a good story. Also, I feel like the quality of trainees in Boys Planet was just sooo top tier compared to so many shows. I remember seeing the Top 18 and thought, yea the talent here is really great, I could see two teams forming from them. Like Fantasy Boys airing around the same time, people could see the difference LOL. Also not for nothing, I think the advantage of BP trainees skewing a bit older made me remember why debuting trainees that have had years of experiences vs. like 2 months makes soo much of a difference. Like thinking about 3rd gen when you had idols like Twice's Jihyo (10 years trainee) and Exo's Suho (7 years) or like the average being 2-4 years of trainee experience for debuted idols vs. now where I feel like the trainee periods in general can feel like less than 6 months for some (and it shows). Ofc there's always exceptions to that, but even then, with idols like Baekhyun and Chen (who both were like less than a year, maybe only a few months) were already a bit older when they debuted so just goes to show experience matters.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
