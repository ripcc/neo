It's not actually an sf war but Rosins are laughing about it because they have Hao's records from every school he went to and all those records say excellence. Rosins are now making fun of Hanbin's education üò≠. I think, Allins shouldn't talk about Hao's education because the guy is obviously smart, not even fabricated because it can easily be debunked if he lies. Jzeroses are even researching about China's acceleration policy after Hao shared that he skipped 2nd grade because that process is only for few people to be granted. Like, just let Hao be an overachiever in his education. If they're bitter that Hanbin isn't academically smart, they can brag about the MC excellence that Hao wouldn't be able to touch in this lifetime</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I can like try to mentally break it down so her flights are definitely the most expensive and if she's not staying over 1-2 weeks accommodation shouldn't be that expensive and the concert fees plus shopping hmmmmm she's probably spending somewhere around $2k USD for every trip but that's not counting fansign stuff Ok that's assuming she's flying from Canada I looked at the tweet again maybe she's a student abroad in korea?
