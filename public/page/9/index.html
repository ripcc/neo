Anon you need to stop making out like there’s been some long standing connection there when there literally hasn’t because you do realise for the idea of an allin being behind that account to be feasible you’d have to be suggesting that on a random day in 2024 a random allin decided to make a bibigo account and then not tweet or follow anything about hb until March 2025 in an elaborate plan to engagement bait.

I feel like everyone on here knows that but it's still weird for zerocolas to dig for stuff or cross boundaries since he'll tell them what they want to hear even without the leading questions. Like asking him what he would do if his phone gallery got hacked is crazy work that's when I feel for the dude.

As much as I hate it the whole made this thing did catch onto the kside and big food brand were even using it in their advertising (I think it was kfc) so like that really doesn’t mean anything. Also they didnt start following and hb fans till today which is what the rosins picked up on and it wasn’t just hb fans they were literally following anyone. Also when their account first opened their first load of tweets were about someone from monsta x coming back from the military and giving him bibigo? The only time a zb1 member has ever been slightly acknowledged by the account was for the mandu thing and even then they had replied to many other fan accounts before that so really this is a nothing burger.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
