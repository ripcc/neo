It’s really weird with Gunwook though because he can reach high notes smoothly if he focuses on it (and when he’s singing in range with his vibrato it’s so freaking good) but he rarely does it. He opts for more “shouting” it. Listen to his high note from the new street fighter song zb1 dropped and you’ll know what I mean. I wonder if it’s an issue of most zb1’s songs being too high, an issue of just normalized bad technique, or sort of laziness. 😅 I’m not super super knowledgeable about singing so if you know more plz elaborate (or any anons) if it’s a technique thing or a tone thing</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Plus like gd is signed to a label with Palestinian ties while bighit is up scooter Braun’s ass. They can argue that it isn’t up to the artists YADDA YADDA but at the end of the day supporting big hit groups helps fund Zionist with funding ties to Israel. I’d rather the money go to Palestine.

Yeah no. It’s limiting the potential of the rest of the group and idgaf if they won 1&amp;2 on boys planet anymore. If I see their popularity divide continue to grow and ZB1 become like Astro with Eunwoo being the only one well known and no one gaf about the other members like Sanha I’d kms. I’m pro-disbandment just for this. May their situation hopefully be their own version of popular groups/solos post survival show group disbandment like Le Sserafim (pre-Coachella), IVE, Yena, etc. If somehow fuckass starship ent. locked in and used the fuck out of Wonyoung and Yujin to make IVE humongous I’m praying other companies will do the same with the other members, maybe even buy out some of the contracts 🤞</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

Looking at the lineup you can tell it is a big4 domination. Okay i know you dont fw kiof but at least imo they deserve it more than some of the bg here. Even with tbz, they don't have a successful release this year but they have better recognition in kr than some of the lineup</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
<small>2024-11-26 06:31:04</small></header><p>Yea and the difference between them kiof is that they're a boy group with a guaranteed audience kiof are more popular but they don't have a fandom like that and tbz are switching through management god knows what they're doing rn. Looking at the lineup you can tell that these are all just the current big groups and zb1 is part of the first lineup there'll be artists like stayc and fromis on there eventually it'll just be the third lineup</p></div></section></article></article><article class=PostWrapper><div class=postHeader><a class=index href=/posts/7851ca59fe57c75875984bcf8d2a5769275b7514acaa6ed32756475ddba7dd4d/>#5447
