I don't think he's manipulative and shady if anything he's an extreme overthinker and sometimes struggles to place his emotions accurately. If you only ever watch him in group variety shows because you don't give a fuck about him and don't check on his solo stuff and messages how would you even know? Saying he's manipulative and outright shady when he always shows he cares for his members in his own ways (giving them music lessons, writing songs for matthew, getting closer to ricky who clearly struggles to feel included sometimes etc.), saying he's too clingy when he only ever does it to two members (yujin and gyuvin) to show he cares (he used to do the same thing to jihoo and munjung, it's what he always does to younger members who he cares about) it all sounds a bit too much, it's not unlikely that gyuvin said something hurtful to him considering he was depressed as fuck for the past few months and that gyuvin often speaks before he thinks and there's been tension sometime before that even sometimes gyuvin literally looked like he wanted to off himself when Taerae literallt just held his shoulder or whatever, anyway I don't think it's fair to judge Taerae on anything if you don't even pay attention to him outside of group variety shows</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

He can’t sing, can’t dance, is friends with Hyuna, a HYBE bootlicker and is wildly unfunny. If he was straight no one would care about him. People argue he isn’t a good singer because he’s indie and didn’t have a company that supplies vocal training… like Bffr it’s been years and he still can’t hold a note. He annoys me and like obviously the fact he’s out and proud is amazing but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t suck at singing and like, I still can’t get over the Hyuna bestie shit.</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>

I actually think they are in new dorms because from the bit we saw in Matthews pancake live it doesn’t look like the izone dorms and fromis lived in penthouse bit of the old pledis building so it’s definitely not that dorm since the members have mentioned neighbours.
