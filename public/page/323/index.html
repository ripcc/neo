A part of me feels alot of them are lowkey aware of the rumours too and for the most part just ignore them now ? And like you said not just with zb1 but with all survival groups once they disband a lot of the akgaes will leave. A big reason they even stay here is to feed on that survival mode and competitive instinct, to make everything a competition in the limited time we have left. I can guarantee from most subfandoms whether we like it or not a good chunk will tune into bp 2 and if it lines up with zb1s disbandment a lot will move onto the new survival group . /+r/145694516949766298</p></div><div class=Reply><header><strong>requeefiem</strong>
