        <p>Not to be that person but who is the most popular member in SK currently? Why do I feel like by the end of the contract the most popular member or atleast 2 in the top 4 will be unexpected. Certain members are starting to make traction with less schedules, it&#x27;s like people are tired of seeing the same members on their screens or something <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/154694392500936701" class="replyLink">/+r/154694392500936701</a></p>
