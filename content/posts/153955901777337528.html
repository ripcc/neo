        <p>I think his personality fit western celeb life style more? Bust out music whenever they wanna, post on ig every now and then, go mia for 2 months then suddenly drop new music/ cover/ photoshoot and repeat and random tiktok/ ig lives in between. I just find it funny his fans preach about loving him for who he is and how he&#x27;s different but in the same breath be comparing him to other members with all these graphs because he isnt going on pchat every fucking day and can&#x27;t accept that he&#x27;s different so they start blaming anything and everything. Please he is not pchat banned... and when u say that to them they&#x27;re like &#x27;oh yeah? rmb when u guys were crashing out when the group got banned for a week? we had to deal with this ban since nov 2023 so don&#x27;t talk&#x27; and I&#x27;m like umm yeah because a plane full of ppl died and the other ban was cause the fucking president was getting impeach you dumb fucks, so you&#x27;re saying whatever ricky did to get &#x27;banned&#x27; since nov 2023 was worst then those two combined???????? Him not being socially active isn&#x27;t even a bad thing but they made it into a bad thing because they were comparing him to the members after preaching about loving him for being different and not like other idols. I love ricky too but like his fans pmo so much that the only way I can enjoy him is just not engage with them at all and i only follow some of his k fan accounts. /+r/153576961845975707</p>
