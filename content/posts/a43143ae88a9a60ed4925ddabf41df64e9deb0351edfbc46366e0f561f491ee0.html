      <p>i&#x27;m hanbin biased and yaaaaassss that sounds fine like equal parts singing and variety seems chill (that&#x27;s chuu&#x27;s thing right?). i kinda want to see him as a dance mentor on a survival show (mnet are probably already thinking it heh), not a judge bc the judges get shat on so hard like yoon omg but if he came in for like an episode or 2 that&#x27;d be cute. allins want him to be an actor so bad and i&#x27;m sorry but idc like first of all i don&#x27;t watch dramas or shows in general so i would not be tuning in unless they gave him something real interesting and they probably won&#x27;t... the troubles of having a cute personality and boyfriend visuals and second of all his dancing and singing is too fuckin good especially the dance like THAT&#x27;S why i stan him so i want to SEE IT for a long time i don&#x27;t get this desperation for acting when he&#x27;s already doing what he excels at and it&#x27;s great and fun. like idk the way they focus on the acting sometimes sounds like they&#x27;re forgetting about his performance skills and are fine with him abandoning it like idc if i&#x27;m being dramatic but NO. i personally either want him as a soloist or that rumour/manifestation ppl were saying about matthew and gunwook redebuting with him.. if that was even really a thing idk</p>

      <p>I wanna say it&#x27;s definitely closer to a 70/30 with chuu she doesn&#x27;t release music often but it&#x27;s a plus which I see cuz a full on solo career isn&#x27;t a good idea the turnout rate is crazy for people who don&#x27;t grab immediate attention but yea idky fans like the actor route it&#x27;s so stupid and idk how people who like idols like that shit you don&#x27;t see anything they showcase anymore like at all... but yea the rumor about the group with them two doesn&#x27;t sound so bad I&#x27;d be coo with it too better option for both Matthew and gunwook it&#x27;s not like they have other prospects</p>
