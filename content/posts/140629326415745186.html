      <p>Someone said if they are trying to get wakeones attention through tags X is going to be more effective anyway. My guess is that within our own sf his c fandom is always fighting with the other big 3 (I mean they all fight with eachother but the other 3 pack sorta equal punches) so maybe they just rather not broadcast it all there yet? /+r/140613173953911844</p>
