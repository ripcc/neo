      <p>all boils down to how Wakeone managed the situation. It was awful. There are lots of options way better than the way they handled it and I will never forgive wakeone for it. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve wasted money, time and efforts only for Jiwoong to bring ZB1 into nugudom</p>

I&#x27;ve just never seen a company allow their idol that kinda freedom amidst SCANDAL and not even issue one apology the nerve to make threats too wow I&#x27;m getting mad this was easily the worst thing ever</p>
