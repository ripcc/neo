      <p>Diff anon and my two cents. Context is really important because older Chinese immigrants from +40-20 years ago is so different than the new Chinese immigrants from 10 years ago to now. The older +40-20 years ago Chinese immigrants most likely had no choice but to leave because of war. political viewpoints. crashing economy or even seeing no hope in the country itself so it wasn&#x27;t really a choice they can say no to because they had to make that choice in order to survive for a better life whether in American, Canada, Europe or neighboring Asian countries and in most cases they have no idea what they&#x27;re stepping into and were desperate. So it makes sense that these older Chinese immigrants are homesick and no matter how hard they try they can never get accustom to which ever country they immigrated to and go back when they&#x27;re older if able.. Meanwhile the new Chinese immigrants in the past 10 years willingly chose to come to America or where ever to start a new life and these new Chinese immigrants are all privileged to say the least and know what they&#x27;re stepping into, preparing years in advance to make the move with their entire family. To be honest you can tell the difference just from their demeanor, the older Chinese immigrants are often stigmatized for being stubborn and not learning the culture of the country they&#x27;re in, barely knowing any English even though they were in America for 30 years but the newer Chinese immigrants are more opened to it and even celebrating American holidays because this is the new life they willingly chose with no burdens.</p>
