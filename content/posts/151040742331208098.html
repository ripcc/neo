        <p>the mattraebin unit pic is only ass because wakeone didn&#x27;t even pretend to try the hao unit was shot like a photoshoot with the positions, the gw unit made use of the pretty background and posing meanwhile the mattbinrae unit looks like those photoshopped melon pics where they edit the group members next to each other for a header LMAO but wakeone doesn&#x27;t exactly have the best track record with both matthew and taerae when it comes to effort so I&#x27;m not surprised this looks ass lmao</p>
