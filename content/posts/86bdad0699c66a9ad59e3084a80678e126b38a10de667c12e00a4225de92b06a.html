      <p>ive been losing interest in the tour with each date it seems like the members were kinda tired lowks but a repeated setlist can only squeeze so much excitement down the line it was fine but i think yea people probably expected it to be more hype since it was cfans and the covers but it wasnt a success like dilaw. mmmm the parts where the crowd didnt interact with the members when they did the screen thing was kinda crazy but overall it was alright im just waiting for this bullshit to be over</p>
