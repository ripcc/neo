      <p>Niki is so handsome. It&#x27;s just that, his features aren&#x27;t typical unlike the generic face that Hanbin has which is palatable. But Niki is seriously handsome. I saw a collage of enhypen with Hao where our twink is mogging everyone but at least Niki can keep up. Hanbin would definitely be more handsome in Korean standard but internationally, it&#x27;s Niki.</p>

      <p>i see what u mean his face is unique yes i think hes good looking if i saw him on the street id be like woah but he can be so hit or miss maybe it comes down to styling also i dont know him or care about him so he loses points in my book</p>
