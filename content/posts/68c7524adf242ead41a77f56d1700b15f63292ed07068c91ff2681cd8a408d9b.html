      <p>I think anon means his company has made it obvious they will take him back there’s more detail into it that moon knows and she’d probably be able to tell you a lot more than I can explain here but yeah I think regardless if he wants to stay ( which I imagine he does) I feel they will pull a 143 ent on him unless he leaves the l1ve</p>

      <p>oh ok that makes sense i thought there was something new being spread around and yea out of all the companies its obvious his is the one that wants him back the most yuehua just has the reputation of declining extensions? so because of that people assume theyr the issue and theyre not wrong since they have claim on 4 members not one but yea ill ask moon</p>
