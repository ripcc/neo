        <p>The unit songs must have leaked somewhere because two separate people came to hao&#x27;s dcgall to give spoilers about the hao gyuvin jiwoong songðŸ˜­ If the spoilers are real (they could be trolls) then it&#x27;s more vocal heavy not the more rap heavy stray kids esque song that versachoi is known for. I was lurking around to try and find other unit song spoilers but haven&#x27;t seen anything yet</p>
