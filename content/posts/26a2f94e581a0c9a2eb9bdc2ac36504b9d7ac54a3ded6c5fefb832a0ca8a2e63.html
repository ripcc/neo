      <p>I kinda like this format, it&#x27;s easier to read paragraphs and curiouscat would always have some fcking issues typing or sending links with special characters. Also you can search on here!!! I will miss ur iconic cc but I guess everything needs a new start</p>

      <p>same there&#x27;s so many things we could never do that we can do now like even posting pics? I gotta figure out how but I&#x27;ve seen it be done I&#x27;m really sad about losing cc but maybe good will come out of this</p>
