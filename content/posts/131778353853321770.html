        <p>not anon and the two boys from project7 are good looking enough tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è if bebe trains them in dancing they could become a dance heavy boy group... THELIVE PLS SNATCH GUNWOOK UP üò≠üò≠ that junwon(?) guy has a face that would look great with gunwooks and hanbins. visual chemistry is important. that other guy (jiwoon(?)) looks like a hao remake. he looks like a twink but thats good since kpop stans dont stan groups that have no twink in them üòÇ no shade to hao or anything. i love my boy matthew BUT his height will be a problem... if matt grows a few inches im on board with this üî• <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/131740276489409186" class="replyLink">/+r/131740276489409186</a></p>

      <p>i can already see their positions within the group if thelive were to go along with this. gunwook would be the maknae and the two project7 dudes would be the groups main ship until hanbin takes one of them. we would have a jikook/taekook situation. i would make the junwon guy the leader since he is the oldest and he looks more like one than hanbin. we just need someone to match matthews vibes and height... if we dont he is about to get DRAGGED to filth, which is not that bad since people would move on from gunwook üßê <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/131767373765236436" class="replyLink">/+r/131767373765236436</a></p>
