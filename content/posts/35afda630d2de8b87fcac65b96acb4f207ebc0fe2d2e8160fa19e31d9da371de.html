      <p>i have a feeling it&#x27;s bc they&#x27;re from mnet and that&#x27;s their competition.. planet b will probably have a zb1 cover or two bc they&#x27;re not in an awkward spot (like how x1 disbanded bc of the rigging stuff so they don&#x27;t get covered by anyone period - except for zb1 doing those umjigyeo covers for some reason lmao - and wanna one aka a produce group isn&#x27;t directly related to the planet series technically) and are popular</p>

      <p>ahhhhh true true I didn&#x27;t think of that I feel like I&#x27;ve only seen energetic covers from izone and zb1 too so that makes sense I think move was just really popular and since zeroses are survival show watchers it makes sense</p>
