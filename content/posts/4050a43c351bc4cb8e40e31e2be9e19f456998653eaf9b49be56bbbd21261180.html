      <p>i looked into what this stays vs taerae thing is and basically taerae won the ost award against seungmin and a stay posted a screenshot of a korean tweet from a taerae stan/zerose (?) that said something like they spent 1 million dollars on votes ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ now idk if itâ€™s a mistranslation or they fr said that but if someone really did say that i feel like itâ€™s obvious that theyâ€™re joking around or being hyperbolic, tho these ppl are just believing it bc itâ€™s korean and taking it so seriously, saying taerae has payola and is a nobody and is gonna disband while skz thrive like ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­</p>
