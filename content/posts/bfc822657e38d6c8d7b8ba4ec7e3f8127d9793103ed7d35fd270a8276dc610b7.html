      <p>that was the cult theory which is based off his aversion to drinking/smoking his family size plus other behavior it&#x27;s obviously only a theory cuz we don&#x27;t know he doesn&#x27;t talk about god or Christianity in depth (like tbz for ex you can tell who&#x27;s religious they always talk about church and the Bible and what not) all we know is that he&#x27;s from a Christian family and went to church camp or smth. And even if he was drinking wouldn&#x27;t be scrutinized Koreans love them some alcohol</p>
