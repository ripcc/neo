        <p>is this basically buying a spot into a fancall from someone who&#x27;s actually gotten in without having to buy all the albums and such yourself? this reminds me of before covid and fancalls existing when international fans would buy fansign slots and then have the person who went to the fansign ask questions to their bias and get them a signed page or album i lowkey remember being jealous of that LMAO. that but actually being able to get into the fancall and talk to the idol yourself is wild to me (if that&#x27;s the case) <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/161001386673397674">/161001386673397674</a></p>

        <p>im not 100% sure i didnt translate the post but from guessing i would say theyre doing the album code thing theyre basically paying for the fansign cut without actually buying the physical album (its just annoying to have all that) so theyll receive the codes at that price w a guarantee of getting in i could be wrong tho lolll. im positive you cant just buy someones slot your name has to be the same and you wouldnt wanna receive an album w someone elses name. and i rmbr thatttttt the amt of times i almost folded IT WAS TOO TEA BACK THEN</p>

      <p>you can still buy asking questions to your bias, having them answer a sticky note question or personalized signatures if you scroll hard enough you&#x27;ll see zb1 posts for those for example sometimes zcs do that instead of going to fansigns themselves <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/161015492205828030">/161015492205828030</a></p>
