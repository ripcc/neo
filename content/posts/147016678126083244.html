current yes24 zerobase showcase winner list for this cb: <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/waefng.jpeg">https://files.catbox.moe/waefng.jpeg</a> a fansign winner list: <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/xeqbd5.png">https://files.catbox.moe/xeqbd5.png</a> the name she gave on kepler blacklist is only half her name, the full one is on the showcase winner list, and you can see her phone number which matches the mcd blacklist on the fansign list. her tiktok account also displays her birth year that&#x27;s the same on the blacklist. i heard she still sneaks into mcd in disguise to get past the staff even after the blacklist lmao </p>
