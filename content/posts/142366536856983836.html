        <p>Lowkey he was doing a bit of both, maybe not so much near crush time but deffo pre debut - 1st fancom time because whenever theyâ€™d be in stage your always see him giving stage directions ect to members and they never had a performance director in sight. I wouldnâ€™t say he had the full responsibilities of their performance director but itâ€™s really clear wakeone was under prepared in many aspects to take on zb1 and really just used his back group to try and quickly fill a gap he shouldnâ€™t have had to fill tbh <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/142087040635460241">/142087040635460241</a></p>
