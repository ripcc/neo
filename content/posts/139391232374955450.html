        <p>I think because it&#x27;s an undisclosed schedule that&#x27;s not supposed to be shared like no one really knows what they are doing in Thai, some says they shoot mv there and the other says it could be for variety show but no one really knows other than those who bought info.
Also the way they put on mask and there was no photo session after getting of the car, I feel like they trying ninja-ing their way to Thai but the news is all over the place already so yeah🤷‍♀️ let&#x27;s see for their next official schedule flight, if they still act the same then there is a possibility that wk1 told them to. Zb1 is so friendly with the reporters compared to some idols that I&#x27;ve watched the departure video before
