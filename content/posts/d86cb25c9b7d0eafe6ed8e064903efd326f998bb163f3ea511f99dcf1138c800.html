      <p>so what happened was: the whole ssng issue was exposed 5/25 and it reached 1M views so like everybody on the kside were discussing it but then Nbhungry posted 5/26 about the loewe photo with the big ass watermark of that same ssng that was exposed. she was ratioed so she deleted and acted like nothing happened. but her mutuals (justforluv_ and zho_shb which are some of the biggest nb k-accs) called her out for it asking why would she post that when the ssng was literally just exposed the night before and then act like nothing happened so she had to apologize. no one talks about it now on there bc they want to keep “fandom peace” but nbhungry is content hungry and literally got mad at yujin bc of luckyz boom loll</p>
