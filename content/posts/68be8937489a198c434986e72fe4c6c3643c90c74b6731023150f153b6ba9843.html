      <p>I wonder how much the twitter hate got to ricky about his solo tiktoks or if its just bc they are so busy. I dont need him to be active on social media just kind of miss them, he obviously put a lot of effort into the few he did do</p>

      <p>ik hes secure in himself and headstrong but no ones immune to hate i think it probably did smth if he was aware and fell down a rabbit hole but i dont think the hates at the front of his mind even for him this is a bit much but he could be tired with all the tour stuff hopefully he posts a tiktok soon</p>
