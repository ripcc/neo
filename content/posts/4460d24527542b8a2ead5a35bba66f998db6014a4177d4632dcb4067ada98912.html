      <p>i&#x27;m not a wizone and therefore don&#x27;t keep up with them often so i could be wrong but i feel like their reunions aren&#x27;t too far apart like it feels like members are always guests on radio shows together or hanging out every few months when i would&#x27;ve expected way less of that so i&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll be like that post-zb1 bc that just seems nice and i can&#x27;t see myself moving onto other groups (other than their own post-zb1 stuff) like i&#x27;m in this zerose shit for lifeeeeee. idk if other survival show groups are that close and do all that or if it&#x27;s just izone thing but if it&#x27;s just an izone thing then i hope they follow their path lmao</p>
