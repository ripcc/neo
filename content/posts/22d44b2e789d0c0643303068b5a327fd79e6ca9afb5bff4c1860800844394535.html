      <p>cmuls are having a field day because it&#x27;s almost guaranteed that cris won&#x27;t reach the purchase goal of 10000 sets that kato gave them. they&#x27;ve been stalking cris for days and some even posted on ricky&#x27;s supertopic just to mock them. I didn&#x27;t know their beef was this wild.</p>
