      <p>honestly did you have an idea about overlining like i keep stay out of this discussion but he&#x27;s the only member i think who loves to experimenting his makeup since debut, he&#x27;s in less makeup phase in debut era and then suddenly he loves glitters and started doing tanghulu lips every single time, idk what makeup he&#x27;s in right now but i miss when he put glitters in everything <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138797580250470061" class="replyLink">/+r/138797580250470061</a></p>

      <p>over lining and overall fullness are two diff things he has makeup on that&#x27;s obviously making it more dramatic but it isn&#x27;t purely makeup that&#x27;s making me raise an eyebrow. His lips don&#x27;t have bad migration tho so there&#x27;s that</p>
