      <p>If you&#x27;re a singer or actor who fucked up in Korea or anywhere else, just go to the Philippines and restart your career there because the country is forgiving as long as you&#x27;re serving your purpose. They aren&#x27;t moral police. You can be jailed, do drugs, be a bully, rape someone or be a horrible person and you&#x27;ll still have a career. That one bully Kdrama actor who was cancelled in Korea is now an actor in the top tv channel there. They care about your craft not your crap. See how Jiwoong is so loved after he ruined his group. ðŸ˜‚</p>
