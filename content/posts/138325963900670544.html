        <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/ringsarix/status/1879042551069786124?s=46"></a></blockquote> do these people know the boys themselves chose which challange to film? they are unknowingly bashing the other five for having fun and doing tiktoks. go tell ricky to be more active on sns and not care that much about his image ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è he is not the babygirl yall want him to be. it was clear as day that ricky was never going to do the shanghai challenge. ricky doesnt do silly/goofy. he takes shit serious and has a clear idea about what his image will be</p>
