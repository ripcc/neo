      <p>I&#x27;ve said it before but all involved companies would profit way more if zb1 was permanent than if they broke up like even if you just get a 10% cut of their stuff you&#x27;d still earn way more than you will ever be if they&#x27;re stuck in nugu tier and then eventually disband after 3 years ðŸ¤£</p>
