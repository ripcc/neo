      <p>There&#x27;s def an uptick in kfans I like to check on the twitter tags theres a lot more engagements with posts a new translator popped up too. But I think the access fans get from him attracted people and he&#x27;s the energetic puppy type so it&#x27;s not surprising he&#x27;s always hit it off with younger fans too</p>
