        <p>This is a non issue for him cuz he is definitely getting paid and we weren&#x27;t gonna compare everglow with who made negative profit. I still want him leave the company if it&#x27;s possible cuz their promo sucks that&#x27;s all <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160468425314098032">/160468425314098032</a></p>
