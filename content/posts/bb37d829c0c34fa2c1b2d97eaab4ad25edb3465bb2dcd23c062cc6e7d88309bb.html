      <p>one of my friends is a Chinese immigrant and her parents own a business here that they are going to sell when she gets her degree and they will go back to China and theyve been in america for like 20ish yrs. I do think Ricky&#x27;s family will stay in America but cases like that do happen cause some people just don&#x27;t like America or miss their extended family idk</p>

      <p>GYATDAMNNNNNN but that seems different 20ish years is the turnover rate for a lot of immigrants its usually around then that they start retiring or just planning to live in their homeland again but rickys family is new to america they havent even been ther 10 years and esp in rickys sisters case she came in elementary so she grew up in america more</p>
