        <p>Actually I saw a tweet from this allin account saying how fun it is when the three MCs are together and some mulbokdan qrt with ‚Äú If you saw the big show today, no one would have refuted this statement. If the MCs and some members hadn&#x27;t pushed themselves too hard, the atmosphere would have been so bad that it would have been impossible to continue. It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re doing badly because they&#x27;re rookies, but it&#x27;s like they were dragged out of a public place against their will. I was looking forward to seeing the members for the first time in a long time, but I was embarrassed the whole time. I think from next time, only the members who want to appear should appear‚Äù and then a kgpd qrt then mentioning hanbin and then it just tunred into burner accounts going back and forth and dying off into personal insults. Tbh I‚Äôm still not sure what the issue actually was, no one on the I side said anything even the akgaes so I guess it‚Äôs died over there now. <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/140869963996157005" class="replyLink">/+r/140869963996157005</a></p>

        <p>Wait so are they saying some of the members made the atmosphere bad? I&#x27;ve only seen clips and aside from myngj dick riding the extrovert members made it fun so I don&#x27;t get it are they blaming gwk and tartar im assuming cuz their fans jumped in üò≠ I hate only seeing the aftermath cuz that&#x27;s what I saw but yea probably an in the moment thing you&#x27;d have to understand. I saw one and only one alln akgae hop in and they were just calling zbwon shitty actors so I&#x27;m not sure</p>

      <p>different anon but i think some of the members were tired (like hao for example) since the prerecording was at midnight and didn‚Äôt speak much. i watched the whole thing and i thought the daechinso lives with fewer zb1 members were more fun, it‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt know how to deal with the whole group so hanbin kept involving jaehyun and it felt like the live centered around him too much but idk there were still some funny moments <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/140896534068941226" class="replyLink">/+r/140896534068941226</a></p>
