        <p>i can already see their positions within the group if thelive were to go along with this. gunwook would be the maknae and the two project7 dudes would be the groups main ship until hanbin takes one of them. we would have a jikook/taekook situation. i would make the junwon guy the leader since he is the oldest and he looks more like one than hanbin. we just need someone to match matthews vibes and height... if we dont he is about to get DRAGGED to filth, which is not that bad since people would move on from gunwook üßê <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/131767373765236436">/131767373765236436</a></p>
