      <p>you probably have not watched either videos but jw sometimes make comments that make me a bit uhhh like when gv, tr and him had that &quot;family&quot;skit and they were supposed to be the same age so tr dropped formalities and jw was literally tweaking even asking the filming crew &quot;is trs concept talking down on me today??!?!?&quot; and then in the spotify video from today he said that he often asks tr if he&#x27;s eaten to be polite and tr like answers really shortly and he that he does not get sad but instead thinks &quot;what is this arrogance?&quot; like what is his problem lmao</p>
