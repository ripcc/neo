      <p>i feel like this has been reignited by current zerose briize beef rn but something that bothers me to this day is how eunseok is relatively unscathed by his string of scandals (from litr pimping out his members to hanging with terrible ppl) on the k-side while the entirety of zb1 is still suffering bc jiwoong shibal and his bbl response like damn. one thing about sm is that they will shut their artists up and keep them quiet until shit blows over we seriously needed to duct tape uncle&#x27;s mouth at the time</p>
