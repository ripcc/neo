        <p>im ngl while u sometimes have a point about ricky maybe not wanting to go on pluschat/do certain tiktoks + i definitely don&#x27;t think sinophobia is the factor (or at least primary factor) in play + riyangis are indeed dumb af w the way they go about things, i think there is pretty ample evidence that he is treated exceptionally poorly under wk1 (recent example: dispatch post on weibo with only 8 members)</p>

        <p>I never once said rky doesn&#x27;t have real moments of mismanagement tho I&#x27;d always say every stupid complaint and act up by ryangis lessens the impact of things that actually matter like all the time ðŸ˜­ this is wkn issues are their second nature my point has always been that it&#x27;s less likely targeted and just an example of a poorly run company. Idk what this is all about but that does suck I&#x27;ve already got mention ab yh in my inbox but I woke up randomly and I&#x27;m bouncing so I&#x27;m not getting into that rn</p>

      <p>I kinda think riyangis need to group together and scold Wakeone under certain points like visa issues, misplacing his stuff, no socmed posts about him on the official accs, but regarding others like that Shanghai romance TikTok it&#x27;s definitely not his style..... Also Yuehua.... In regards to Wakeone it&#x27;s pot kettle black.... Wakeone sees them as Cannon fodder Yuehua sees them as ATM machines....once the ka~ching goes off it&#x27;s to the dumpster..... /+r/138960892950961624</p>

      <p>Visa issue was completely out of wkns hands, losing the in ears was unfortunate but I guess it&#x27;s been handled and.. alright but the tiktok isn&#x27;t about his style or not yjn just didn&#x27;t ask him ðŸ˜­</p>
