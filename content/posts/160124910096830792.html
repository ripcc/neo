        <p>Tbh not even just sea fans like the rare chance they add Europe and America stops to the tour it will probably be the only chance most of us ever get to see them perform because like 99% of us cannot afford hundreds to fly out to Asia to watch them perform <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/160118341510584167" class="replyLink">/+r/160118341510584167</a></p>
