        <p>well that&#x27;s a scary thought now because i care ab yuehuaz family or anything but if he leaves that means hed be left without a management and worse that he&#x27;ll just leave totally ðŸ˜­ fuck cuz that means never seeing him again oh god, and if he continues with the industry he&#x27;d be alone its tougher ugh tbh all of zb1&#x27;s future looks bleak ðŸ˜­ yuehuaz being the &quot;ive&quot; of zb1 may or maynot be true leaning into maybe not, tho thinking ab gyv not being the same ab rk cuz he&#x27;s leaving yuehua is ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ if he&#x27;s leaving u should stick to him more idk mayeb we dont see it cs he was just saying on his live showing a scar on his leg saying he got it during playing tag with ricky and just saying rk kept apologizing theyr cute ðŸ˜­ but they&#x27;re all panicky ab the future WE GOT A GROUP OF TWEAKERS zb1 are just like their fans smh /+r/148581413053225984</p>

      <p>okay but fr i&#x27;ve been thinking about this more and more recently that zb1&#x27;s futures are about to be so meh just like all the other post-survival show groups (obviously izone was a flash in the pan) like i&#x27;d love for hanbin and hao to live up to their current fame bc otherwise their fall is gonna be nasty or another member to somehow rise up and be even more famous after disbandment - i remember you used to say you could see that for yujin - but i don&#x27;t know i don&#x27;t see these scenarios as being likely AND THEY&#x27;RE ALL SO DEPRESSED ALREADY THEY SERIOUSLY MIGHT OFF THEMSELVES and no one will gaf bc they&#x27;ll have five fans left with me being one of them. contraction extension (with better terms, obviously) is fr the best way forward for all of them and yet....... LMAO /+r/148663156955369887</p>
