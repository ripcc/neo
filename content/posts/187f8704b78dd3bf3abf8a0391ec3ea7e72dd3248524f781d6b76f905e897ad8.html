      <p><a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/7fa3c26041" class="replyLink">/+r/7fa3c26041</a> I actually wonder if the new groups will be permanent I know with izna they are only permanent because all the iland girls signed up to wakeone as trainees but bp2 is still taking other company trainees so they will probably be temporary unless they can get a good deal on the table ? </p>

I feel like the same issue where bp had to be delayed to open up to company trainees is gonna happen if they gun for a permanent group using the izna system soooooooo imma say no but we&#x27;ll see</p>
