      <p>i kinda agree with og anon i just think the way they&#x27;ve worded it is weird. at the same time this anon is right about the zb1 gay agenda like i hate it too. imagine ur outed predebut or at least have all ur controversial gay shit blasted across social media, faced with lots of hate and #that predebut enemy trying to ruin ur career with rumours after ur announced as the centre/member of a group and then fans of the group either forget about it or don&#x27;t find it that serious despite the sociopolitical state of korea and how there are 0 actual kpop idols who are out as gay so they turn ur sexuality into the group&#x27;s &#x27;brand&#x27; and can&#x27;t go one second without mentioning it bc &quot;fruity 🏳️‍🌈💅✨&quot; is the peak of comedy apparently. i&#x27;d be a lil mad <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/146327234993674069" class="replyLink">/+r/146327234993674069</a></p>

      <p>thats not what og anons point was tho theyre literally the people you just mentioned making it their brand. zbwons group and individual identity has nothing to do with sexuality yet their own fans only peddle the whole &#x27;gay group&#x27; thing on twitter and have been making tweets for the past two days saying that their funniest and best jokes are solely gay and mrpeg jokes 😭 then they get mad when non fans use that as ammo like please</p>
