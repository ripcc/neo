        <p>i agree about matty but gunwook???? boy doesn&#x27;t even get jobs and only guesting in &lt;30mins youtube shows. backpacker put matty as first name making him the only one getting it all while gunwook get nothing even though, imo he carry the whole song. they were bitter about ppusamz and keep fighting seokryus whenever he hangs out with jwg, now matty stay away from him suddenly its mattparkz being pushed??? <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/155496921086251310" class="replyLink">/+r/155496921086251310</a></p>
