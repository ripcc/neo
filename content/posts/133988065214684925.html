        <p>genuinely believe gw better take musical actor route after disbandment or find a good agency from jp. kpop is so dead and boring, i think investors also not really fond of investing in k-ent industry these days. also this is the era of non-idol survival and reality show, like single inferno or culinary wars, entertainment industry is so not promising like how it use to be. unless you got a hugeass sponsor behind the scene, that&#x27;s a different story!</p>
