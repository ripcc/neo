        <p>saw the yuna sullyoon and karina stage and yuna was eating up the two ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ im not even biased sullyoon is super pretty too and her and yuna kinda have similar visuals karina stands out but not in a way that shed eat it up yuna is kinda a performance queen, ig karina matches vibes more with yujin from ive cs she was not as impressive as other two here ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>they balance each other out tbh yuna - stage presence, dance, can&#x27;t sing
sullyoon- sing, dance, no stage presence
karina - mid singing, mid dance, mid stage presence <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/143764454352573502" class="replyLink">/+r/143764454352573502</a></p>
