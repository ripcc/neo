        <p>the meoddongcat contents on zerose tweet has been beneficial to bnd qnd nothing for zb1. Since jaehyun became mc their growth have been crazy. We can agree that their korean platform charting might be manipulated but them charting no.2 In japan is partly our fault by always bringing him in zerose tweet with hanbin that jzerose got curious. It pains me to watch a digital single charting higher than our comeback when they had no fans before while zb1 were kings there.hybe succeeded in stealing from small business because we let them</p>
