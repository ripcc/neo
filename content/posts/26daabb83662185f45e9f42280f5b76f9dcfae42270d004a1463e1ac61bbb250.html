      <p>diff anon and zeroses don&#x27;t wanna admit this but a lot of shippers move exactly like solo subfandoms with their hive mentality and wanting to defend their &quot;reputation&quot; and separate themselves from the fandom or thinking they&#x27;re superior to other shippers (like every solo sf thinks they&#x27;re superior to the others), i noticed their reaction to being whacked when some of them are exposed for doing something bad (like haobinists with that ricky fansign incident/mistine event or gyubrickers with that shipper account who was exposed for shitting on jw) is hardly any different from solos because they will try to deflect/defend each other or just ignore (there are some who will call them out ofc i&#x27;m not denying that) but loool this is a convo no one will be brave enough to have on zerose twt anyway</p>

      <p>well for starters nobody has ever said anything brave on zerosetwt theyll kill you ðŸ˜­ but yea ive said it a couple times some of them are really moving with that very recognizable akgaeish attitude ive just never seen it happen in shippers so its kinda interesting but mainly annoying. idk personally ive never got group mentality or subfandom identity politics cuz i say i hate gpds all the time like idk you could say gpds suck rn and ill be like yeasssssss the amount of times people have talked about shippers here and theres pushback on the fact that it came off generalizing kills me like okay idk if it doesnt apply to you then its ok i promise lolll. its obviously not everyone but idk is it just me i feel like its a more recent thing it wasnt always like this</p>
