      <p>let&#x27;s be real, he never stood out in any round for looks or talent except the first round and that was for talent because he was baked in with a bunch of nugu d and f trainees I don&#x27;t even remember what he did for the second round <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/7e9f7e031c" class="replyLink">/+r/7e9f7e031c</a></p>

      <p>you do understand that he never had a chance he would have less than 2 minutes of screentime in every episode ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ LIKE THATS LITERALLY NOT HIS FAULT the fact that he was able to make it to the top 28 with 0 screentime was a feat he was just stupid and unlucky I don&#x27;t think he would&#x27;ve ever made it into zb1 and he doesn&#x27;t suit them at all but at least he would&#x27;ve left the show with more clout</p>
