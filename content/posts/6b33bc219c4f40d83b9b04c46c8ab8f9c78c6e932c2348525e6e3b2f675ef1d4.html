      <p>jennie was def really loved early bp days then she got into a bunch of dating rumors, kai gd taehyng, being lazy, then half turned against her when The Idol dropped because of that one dance scene and just culture shock, she also started to be more open about partying with western artists and again culture shock for koreans who are very conservative, gyopo and her not releasing songs in korean. I think in Korea she is still the most popular bp member but k gp is 50/50 when early bp almost everyone loved her, just my take tho. I actually think jennie has the most appeal to global audience idk her personality seems appealing to global fans you know that strong independent sensual image but I can see her being too &#x27;bitchy&#x27; too so idk actually ðŸ˜­ also what do u have against jisoo LOOL</p>
