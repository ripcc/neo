      <p>yiren was sent to china bc she was getting A LOT and I mean MASSIVE waves of hate for being the only member who didn&#x27;t do a korean style (kneeling bow) greeting in a fanmeeting during lunar new year in korea. knetz and kfans attacked her relentlessly, called her slurs and told her to go back to china for disrespecting korean culture and wanted her out of the group. The hate was so severe that it was also starting to affect the entire group, and it got worse when yiren posted pro-china stuff on her weibo like the fallen chinese soldiers in the korean war and the xinjiang controversy. Cnetz on the other hand were very supportive of her and mass followed her on weibo for refusing to kneel to the koreans and for being a patriot. THAT was the beginning of everglow&#x27;s downfall bc it was right after that that yuehua shipped yiren to china and put everglow on an indefitine hiatus. Duhua probably thought it was the perfect time to start yiren&#x27;s solo career in china since koreans hated her and she was receiving a lot of support from cnetz, but she flopped in china too and eventually was shipped back to korea. /+r/161194817609749376</p>
