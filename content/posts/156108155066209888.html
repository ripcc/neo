      <p>blue kinda aged like milk for me ðŸ˜… as someone who liked the tiktok snippet and the song first listen, i listened to it for a couple of days and i quickly got sick of it ðŸ˜­ their japanese songs have so much more longevity like yura yura, only one story are still on my rotation even after a whole year and months later i sometimes go back to Now or never too, Now or never wouldâ€™ve been perfect if the line distribution was a little better or else it wouldâ€™ve been one of my top songs from them sighhhh why donâ€™t their kr title tracks give me the same feeling</p>
