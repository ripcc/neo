        <p>there&#x27;s different variety of durian and some taste better than others. I&#x27;ve had one that was milky with a hint a vanilla and another one that was nasty and kinda bitter. I&#x27;ve never had one that tasted like onion though /+r/154586468365590305</p>

      <p>same its not even at my local asian grocery stores but tbh the mixed reviews got it ghfdjfhfdj im not trying it. maybe see if u can get smth durian flavored cuz it would be a huge waste to buy the actual fruit and not like it</p>
