      <p>itâ€™s different with wanna one because their contract was 1.5 years so if they debuted when zb1 did they wouldâ€™ve been disbanding this month. their last couple of months they would talk about wanting to be together forever and their final posts on fancafe (to anyone who doesnâ€™t know itâ€™s an old platform that was kinda like weverse) were depressing as hell. two members worked with heize on the lyrics for this song (english translation is at the bottom <a href="https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2018/06/04/wanna-one-heal-sandglass-molaesigye/">https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2018/06/04/wanna-one-heal-sandglass-molaesigye/</a> ) and this was released 10 months into their contract and itâ€™s an example of how they were bringing up their limited time together. zb1 has eternity but this song hit harder back then because it had self written lyrics. but compared to wanna one I think zb1 talk much more openly about disbandment on their lives <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/ede70a96ed" class="replyLink">/+r/ede70a96ed</a></p>
