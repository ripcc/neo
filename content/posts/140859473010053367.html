        <p>that came from a random predictions account that churns out chatgpt tweets ðŸ˜­ but idk i guess this is where types and personality comes in also running in similar circles. and tbh them dating nugus makes sense theyre close to normal ppl i guess</p>

      <p>it IS they date through circles not randomly picking an idol among all hot gorgeous ones lmaoooo like maybe 0.5% but almost all idols date through frnds setting them up u just gotta know sm1 in their idol circle or be a friend of a friend and they all go for easy dates like same company or more approachable, someone that they&#x27;ve known before which is the case with gv he obvs knew her before, idols wouldn&#x27;t go far they all dating in their circle <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140612649955318440" class="replyLink">/+r/140612649955318440</a></p>
