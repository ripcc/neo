      <p>Zb1 was definitely influential especially hao getting those crazy sales for his first magazine and then ricky doing really well for his too and I remember arenahomme where the whole group got individuals covers right after debut that was also new but tbh its the Chinese market trying a different way to make money off of kpop fans now that they don&#x27;t mass buy albums anymore Cfans have started competing using magazine sales instead of cbar sales and czeroses played a part in this shift too the person who tracks the kpop magazine sales charts on cforums that have gotten posted to weibo and X is a czerose <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/144296007344281382">/144296007344281382</a></p>
