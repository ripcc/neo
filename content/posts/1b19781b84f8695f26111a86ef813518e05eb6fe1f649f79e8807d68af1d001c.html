      <p>Difffrent anon but I feel bad in the sense that regardless of who it is they are going to get lashings from rosins, I mean c rosins are already lashing Yujin because they think heâ€™s apart of it. I guess it better they found out now then on the day though because I feel like the tweak would have been worse.</p>
