        <p>have you ever been to uni cuz that is not how it works ðŸ˜­... he cant become a psychologist after taking 1 year of courses he just switched his major to complete a 4 yr degree. Which means he&#x27;d probably get a bachelors with a major and minor I&#x27;m sure korea operates somewhat differently than what I know but it should roughly be like that</p>
