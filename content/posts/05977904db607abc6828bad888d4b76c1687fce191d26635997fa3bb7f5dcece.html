      <p>The 14 year old staff thing with fantasy boys is a whole different thing, thatâ€™s company condoned grooming ðŸ˜­ so the show got the 13 year old sex pest, the members of the group got k-soul and then Gyurae, the one born in 2008 who was messaging one of his hairdressers who was over 22 (heâ€™s 14) and saying very flirty, couple-y stuff with her and she would say the same types of things to him. Those messages got exposed by a sasaeng who was angry that they spent so much money to get him to debut, and his company denied any inappropriate relationship despite there being pictures, irrefutable evidence, etc. Btw Gyurae, the victim, is a JYP trainee. And one of their other members Ling qi, whoâ€™s friends with Zhang Hao, got exposed for having a girlfriend.</p>
