      <p>I actually think the second one was a k gyuvinist, ik op mentioned hanbin in the og tweet but their second reply under said something about a misunderstanding and calling gyuvin and in the video itâ€™s more obvious it was gyuvin getting called. Idk maybe someone else understands opâ€™s reply better tho ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Yea me and Chanel were looking at the reply to the tweet it mentioned gyuvins and some confusion so it could&#x27;ve been a gyuvin fan? Matthew still ended up calling to hanbin tho so idk</p>
