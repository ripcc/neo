      <p>it just depends because hanbin is far more technically advanced but mattwook have a natural groove to their dancing, but that&#x27;s the whole reason there are different dance genres. someone from a very technical background often isn&#x27;t the best at hip hop, and someone who&#x27;s excellent at hip hop likely won&#x27;t do well with more precise or technical genres. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/1">/1</a>db8c2bbe7</p>
