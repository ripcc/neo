      <p>DBSK stayed DBSK without the most popular members aka Jaejoong and Junsu. It isn&#x27;t impossible for ZB1 to continue since there&#x27;s Hanbin still. But the management should be Thelive. Also, they still have time to boost Matthew, Gunwook and Taerae&#x27;s popularity before the disbandment. There&#x27;s no impossible if company&#x27;s pr team works.</p>

      <p>first off they were in another realm compared to zb1 like wow you cant compare the tvxq peak to zb1.. also they were under sm they forced the remaining 2 to become popular and again this is a survival group why would the other companies continue to keep their idols in a dead mission group please be serious this isnt happeing and yall say this like gunwook or taerae are gonna suddenly become well promoted they wont lol</p>
