      <p>This might sound silly but this whole thing has just killed off any excitement I had for the release and cb because it’s like a reminder that we can never have anything nice and now the fandom is fighting again and it feels like regardless of how good the song is of certain people don’t like aspects of it it’s just going to be complaint after complaint tomorrow</p>
