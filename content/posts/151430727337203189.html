      <p>the thing is there&#x27;s members that can pull off more than one unit song and putting jwg anywhere is ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I&#x27;m gonna pretend there&#x27;s 0 consequences from his side but tbh id just switch him and tr. a rock song might be the most fitting kind of song for his voice and the concept matches him more than both hbn tr so he&#x27;d balance it. kinda like how I could be mad at the shootout cover cuz nobody else would&#x27;ve matched like he did</p>
