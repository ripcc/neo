        <p>kzeroses mad af about the high range of their songs like it still blows my mind away they keep giving them these super high songs (that most of them pull off decently but still) when literally everyone wants to hear them in some lower ranges where they sound better and more comfortable like genuinely curious who&#x27;s behind this</p>

      <p>I agree, most of them can pull it off decently even if these songs are super high but they can show off their skills  wayyyy better if they&#x27;re given a song that matches their vocal ranges, look at the run run gaggery, their two best vocalists also thrive in this range i hope the next title track will bring something different /+r/155356893685177892</p>
