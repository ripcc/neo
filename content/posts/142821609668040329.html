        <p>regarding the comment about jw - was there any actual proof of him having the girlfriend? because i didnt saw any actual proof of that. i remember hearing that someone posted about this on instiz but i wouldnt call it a fully credbile source of information. from what i saw he still has quite a lot of korean fans, even more than mtw i think.</p>

      <p>there&#x27;s a photo of him with her, a very few select members of fanbases have it. i assume wndgs have the same photo and likely more with how many of them left. she&#x27;s a commoner. she&#x27;s pretty but no shade, there&#x27;s a lot of very obvious plastic surgery /+r/142797841310634337</p>
