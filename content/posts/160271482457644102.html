        <p>My take (it&#x27;s lukewarm) is that of course hao feeds into it he&#x27;s smart and caters to fans and I don&#x27;t feel bad at all for him normally when he&#x27;s answering typical ship questions because he obviously dgaf and will answer. I feel like everyone on here knows that but it&#x27;s still weird for zerocolas to dig for stuff or cross boundaries since he&#x27;ll tell them what they want to hear even without the leading questions. Like asking him what he would do if his phone gallery got hacked is crazy work that&#x27;s when I feel for the dude. Two things can be true at once, he&#x27;s good at feeding shippers and the questions are getting weirder <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160128297517404787">/160128297517404787</a></p>

      <p>I agree with anon, he&#x27;s a grown man and he&#x27;s smart and he seems capable of handling stuff on his own anyway and tries to answer what those people want but I feel bad when they take advantage of that like why would you ask him out of everyone what would he do if his phone gallery got leaked ? ðŸ˜Ÿ That&#x27;s just evil considering what he went through lmao <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160133335501462805">/160133335501462805</a></p>
