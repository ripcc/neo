        <p>This might be random but I&#x27;m a yujin stan and subscribed to his pchat for the first time this week and yesterday was his first live wow I didn&#x27;t know he had so many chinese fans the comments were almost 70% chinese and sometimes they&#x27;d type in korean so he&#x27;d understand but you know they&#x27;re chinese because their username is in chinese</p>

      <p>If you look at gyuvin&#x27;s live it&#x27;s actually similar recently cfans decided to spam an encouraging message on his live about him getting mc and it was like 70% of the messages at one point imo cfans are just the largest user base on pluschat and it&#x27;s like this for everyone who has a large cfanbase but yeah yujin is super popular in China for sure agree with that <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/148614696864538190" class="replyLink">/+r/148614696864538190</a></p>
