      <p>https://x.com/jiwoonglesbian/status/1867230677885747265?s=46 Where did stealing gifts even come from ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€ fans gifts were getting returned because no one was at the company to accept the delivery and the only thing Iâ€™ve seen about a missing gift is one fan whose gift got returned saying one box was missing but idk what that has to do with wakeone because the reason it got returned in the first place was because they werenâ€™t thereðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Iâ€™m all for calling out the company like riyangis did with the in ear monitor but thatâ€™s because that actually happened they canâ€™t throw random words to make a story and hope it sticks</p>
