        <p>top instiz article rn with 20k views is about zb1 someone posted how they have been interested with an idol who stands out, sings live and dances well and everyone was guessing since midnight so it was trending then op revealed that it was hao and it got positive responses up until now idk what happened but it seemed like other sfs got offended because the post seem like its shading other zb1 members? now its marked as marple bc they kept fighting on the comments and non fans are just saying that the fandom atmosphere is rly bad and zeroses look crazy ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>op took it down when it had around 500 comments mdhdjhj they said that they will take it down if it gets negative responses but surprisingly all the comments on the first page were positive about hao but allins somehow got a hold of it and were mad as hell bc it looks like op is implying that hao is the only one who stands out and sing live while the rest didnt they were saying that op is a rosin but some are saying its an anti  that wants to cause trouble within the fandom ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it was on the main page and was trending since last night its crazy bc this happens in pann too when hao trends ig thats why his posts are mostly locked /+r/144438966236696927</p>

      <p>Yea I read the comments after everything went down and that&#x27;s what they were saying but idk how true that is considering it was allns who bombed the thread after kzroses were being normal. I didn&#x27;t even see the og post ngnrncnnfmdmdm I guess it&#x27;s just what happens when zgh trends there</p>
