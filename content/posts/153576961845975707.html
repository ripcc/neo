      <p>ricky just doesnt have the personality to be an idol imo i still want to hear him sing and be in the public eye when this group disbands but u srsly cant get his ass to do even bare minimum fanservice like u can see that w how he doesnt do the photocard props properly etc and he looks even worse cuz the other yuehuaz are fan worshippers ðŸ˜­ idrc if he doesnt wanna tweak out bc i dont have a parasocial relationship w him or wtv but a shitton of his fans do so..speaking of u have his terrorist third world fans acting like he gets bullied by the members and the company bruh he just dont wanna do extra fan labor hang it up flatscreen</p>
