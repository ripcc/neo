      <p>it might resurface but again if it&#x27;s the same information we learned it&#x27;ll just shake things a little only because it&#x27;s not concrete but seunghan is finished the people that were originally exposing him might come back and they said they had more soooo we&#x27;ll see as for eunseok he&#x27;s not even a top 3 member so he&#x27;s easier to forgive</p>
