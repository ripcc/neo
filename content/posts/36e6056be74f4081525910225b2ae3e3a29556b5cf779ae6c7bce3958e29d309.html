      <p>i assumed this love your w event was exclusive af for ppl in the industry how did fans get in ðŸ˜­ i&#x27;ve seen videos from other years but they seemed like they were either taken from ppl actually there with just the idols being spotted in the background or by fans but even then it&#x27;d be far away and i assumed usually through a window (tho i have no idea how the building they host this in works). i saw a video of them waving to a haobin account and another of hao literally talking to a hao account asking him if he was drinking lmao</p>
