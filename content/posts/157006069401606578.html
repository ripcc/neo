        <p>Fan service aside… insane fans aside… Hao’s fatass mouth aside (love you Hao but stfu sometimes)… misinterpretations aside… the most telling thing about Haobin is that it’s pretty much confirmed that hao said 真正意义上的初恋 (first love in the truest sense) about Hanbin considering it came from the same person who originally shared the pfp rumor which hao confirmed himself.. since he said this in private on WeChat while having hb as his pfp at the time… this shows that at least some point in time Haobin have had something romantic going on… they could be good friends now but especially given the phrase he used and their bond, this type of love is hard to get rid of…</p>

      <p>anon i don’t think anyone here is denying haobin are dating currently or at the very least romantically involved 😭 it’s more about haobinists being weird and running along with weird narratives but then again it’s shippers in their shipper world like idgaf tbh <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/157001732105395217">/157001732105395217</a></p>
