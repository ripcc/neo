        <p>okay but fr i&#x27;ve been thinking about this more and more recently that zb1&#x27;s futures are about to be so meh just like all the other post-survival show groups (obviously izone was a flash in the pan) like i&#x27;d love for hanbin and hao to live up to their current fame bc otherwise their fall is gonna be nasty or another member to somehow rise up and be even more famous after disbandment - i remember you used to say you could see that for yujin - but i don&#x27;t know i don&#x27;t see these scenarios as being likely AND THEY&#x27;RE ALL SO DEPRESSED ALREADY THEY SERIOUSLY MIGHT OFF THEMSELVES and no one will gaf bc they&#x27;ll have five fans left with me being one of them. contraction extension (with better terms, obviously) is fr the best way forward for all of them and yet....... LMAO <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/148663156955369887">/148663156955369887</a></p>
