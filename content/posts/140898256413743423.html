        <p>everything got deleted so I can&#x27;t tell but they were mad for something about mca/daechinso im assuming daechinso since I kept seeing riize and bnd being brought up and I was looking through burners and these kallins and kgpds were going back and forthhhh they started dropping ugly pictures and vids ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ im inclined to believe the allins started it tho everything started from two allin burners that everyone quoted and hopped in</p>
