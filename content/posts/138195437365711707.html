      <p>why am i more excited for their jp comeback ðŸ˜… their jp comebacks are fun, the songs are usually top notch, i donâ€™t ever have to worry about music show voting and trying to make myself watch thousands of ads to get them wins ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜ª like korean comebacks im usually working my ass off and Iâ€™m constantly worried about their results on charts ðŸ’”</p>

      <p>well theres 0 content made for fans that arent japanese and since everythings prerecorded its not as fun i think as an intl fan its wayyy easier to imerse myself in korean cbs which we get to see actual pay off from fans working LIKE SOWWYYYYY THE BETTER MUSIC ISNT ENOUGH I NEED THAT KR CB PERC jp cbs are still fun but nothing makes a fandom alive like a krn cb it feels like a lot of people were surprised ab the jp cb even happening</p>
