        <p>i know people are gonna hate me for this but jw strikes me as prone to violence. we already knows he&#x27;s sleazy and shitty and uses the &quot;popular&quot; members for his own gains and doesn&#x27;t actually care about anybody but this clip <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/checkiam_/status/1885646056005976336"></a></blockquote> reminds me how on multiple occasions with multiple members, he&#x27;s been really rough. not to mention that one time he kicked gunwook so hard even hanbin was concerned as fuck.. LAWL. i need this man gone please</p>

      <p>there&#x27;s something so off about every interaction he has with members it&#x27;s either disgusting and yaoi baiting or extremely physical/rough. maybe i&#x27;m reading too much into it but i gen don&#x27;t get how other people haven&#x27;t caught on lmao it&#x27;s lowkey kinda concerning <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/144448775774230684" class="replyLink">/+r/144448775774230684</a></p>

      <p>people just ignore to see things how they are and that&#x27;s fine anyone can choose what experience they want but I&#x27;ve always hated that about him and it would genuinely freak me out. All his jokes are just aggression, his interactions are never genuine, and there&#x27;s been noticeable dislike for him like it&#x27;s no wonder theres rumors he&#x27;s had beef/yelled at members</p>
