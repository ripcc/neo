        <p>I think the arguments were separate between the kgpd and kkults but it ended up with both sides coming for hbn in that way. Someone else explained that it could&#x27;ve been about how they were acting on dchinso but everything got deleted alr</p>

      <p>basically kallins wanted to drag zb1/shit on them for that stupid daechingo live being awkward and started blaming the members, someone tweeted it&#x27;s only fun when there&#x27;s onlt the 3 mcs there and deleted once it started getting heat, they got clocked even for instiz for trying to start shit and few kfans of taerae and gunwook clapped back saying it was hanbin&#x27;s fault for caring more about myungjae than his own teammates because their favs were getting blamed lol /+r/140898025597001069</p>
