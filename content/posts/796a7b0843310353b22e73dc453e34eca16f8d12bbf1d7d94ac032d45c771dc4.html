      <p>this is so random but id be shut down immediately in a haobinist or rosin space so ill say it here. i think it&#x27;s hilarious that rosins act like haobin is the worst thing for hao when that ship would have died last year if hao didn&#x27;t keep feeding it to this day by saying unhinged things to shippers. it&#x27;s so obvious especially nowadays that hanbin has hella pulled back and tries rly hard to paint it as a friendship meanwhile hao is trying to say they are kissing like im sorry that&#x27;s dtm ðŸ˜­ and if ure on weibo you know hao will give crazy ott fanservice to every type of fan so he clearly wants ship fans to stay and feeds their delusions on purpose. i think he&#x27;s so cool for that btw this isn&#x27;t a diss at all he&#x27;s meant to be an idol and he&#x27;s playing the game well.</p>
