      <p>yeaaaaaa like youâ€™re gonna get them performing remixes with new outfits and new performance probably with a little storyline too and if youâ€™re a multi you might get to see a little interaction with your other fav groups and you can anticipate an award too whatâ€™s not to love about award season ðŸ˜­</p>
