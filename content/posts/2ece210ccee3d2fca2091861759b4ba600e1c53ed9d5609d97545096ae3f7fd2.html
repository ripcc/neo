      <p>Rich ppl things but also once you find a brand that really fits and compliments your body type you go all in because no other brands do it like the og and idt its the same exact style if you look closely there&#x27;s slight variations. I heard wooyoungmi is mad comfortable too while still looking classy so it&#x27;s totally up Ricky&#x27;s alley</p>
