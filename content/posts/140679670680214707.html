        <p>Hmmmmm he always had a pretty good level of English and he&#x27;s not anywhere near the Japanese fluency he has so idt it&#x27;s an English speaking idol but lol I can see why u think that it makes a lot of sense but apparently that&#x27;s not the case. I&#x27;m curious but also not if he&#x27;s still in a relationship down the line people will figure it out soon enough</p>
