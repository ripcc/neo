      <p>they kinda remind me of nmixx like pretty but don&#x27;t stand out. I find them more natural-looking than aespa but aespa at least has the star power and is more interesting personality wise for me to care about them. Also the girl who&#x27;s mcing with gyuvin has a big ass chin and i can&#x27;t stop staring at it ðŸ˜­ /+r/154428475187614255</p>
