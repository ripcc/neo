      <p>im talking about the one that has pics with yaebin on ig and is from canada but studies or studied in korea
maybe it is different ones but if there are two then that girl saying she is his only female friend is already a lie because you have her (the one Iâ€™m talking about) saying she is a friend of his</p>
