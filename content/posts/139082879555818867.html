        <p>okay u guys are pissing me off ftp arrangement was ass, they stacked ricky and yujins parts with their own falsetto and their own lower register when it shouldve been another member with them so its an actual harmony but for encore obviously they can sing both so they had to pick whether to sing the high falsetto or lower register and its pissing me off because ricky didnt even sing it wrong or bad it was just ass song arrangement going from normal voice from prev member part to a sudden falsetto. not even a ricky stan but this is actually irking me so bad acting like he cant sing high notes but ive seen clips on x where he sings live on insta and hes fine and sounds good af doing ballads and falsettos and shit like so many idols cant even sing live on their own lives cause they cant sing and yall holding this one encore against him when he didnt even do it wrong just shit arrangement so start blaming that. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/139034588214416171" class="replyLink">/+r/139034588214416171</a></p>
