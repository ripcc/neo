      <p>Yes the translator who&#x27;s getting jumped from the protect acc was the one who added the double context and when I saw it I was positive it was about the general knowledge bit sorry to them 😭 but also you can&#x27;t dangle crack cocaine and expect these people to actually proceed with caution</p>
