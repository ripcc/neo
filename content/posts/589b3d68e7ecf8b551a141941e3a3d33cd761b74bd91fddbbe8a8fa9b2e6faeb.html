      <p>Idk if I agree with this actually because each member of aespa can sing circles around nj so they do have something outside of their concept and yeah you can agree nj dance better but that&#x27;s not that impressive kpop wise
I know debating artistry in kpop in general is useless but still I feel like that statement is debatable</p>

      <p>aespa arent good dancers and recently only became decent performers when you consider that new jeans have a decent avergae in vocals and theyre good dancers with great presence that puts them above imo i was just saying aespa are an uninteresting group and their concepts the only interesting thing about them</p>
