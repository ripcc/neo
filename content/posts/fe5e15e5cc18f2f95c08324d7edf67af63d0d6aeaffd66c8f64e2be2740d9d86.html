      <p>just saw an allin complain about inadequate schedules and exposure to the public riyangis trynna find an issue with the twitter post in zb1’s account and how it is aggressive/dismissive towards ricky all around whining in taerae’s ost post about him getting another ost (mind you he is one of the members with the least amount of schedules) this entire fandom has lost it and the only thing they think about is how to victimize themselves the most</p>
