        <p>well he&#x27;ll turn 18 when zbwons over so whatever fandom he gets next probably won&#x27;t be opposed to it depending on when he debuts</p>

      <p>girl 2 months- but I think it depends on how many zeroses are close to his age honestly I&#x27;m not aware of how big that demographic is in the fandom since I don&#x27;t follow back ppl under the age of 18 but personally I was there for early days of txt and enhypen and everyone around me were same as the maknaes or younger than them and everyone was reading shipping and reading fics of them but it seems quite different nowww so idk they were strict there too a bit i remember an oomf got jumped for reading txt fics when she&#x27;s the same as them and taekai were almost 20 by then <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140937018313236180">/140937018313236180</a></p>
