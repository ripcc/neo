      <p>gurl I tried and they accused me of being a wakeone defender 😭 the thing is riyangis are soo deep in this wakeone mistreatment conspiracy where there is some truths but also some fake ass shit but the lines between real mistreatment and bullshit is so skewed that every fucking thing has to be wakeones doing. and that&#x27;s what hurts ricky the most because to non riayngis who see through the bullshit conspiracies and see riyangis claim every little thing as mistreatment and blame wakeone for every shortcoming that when there&#x27;s an actual issue and actual mistreatment it loses credibility and the fandom wont take it seriously because riyangis always be crying wolf. for example the mic issue, look how stupid riyangis look blaming wakeone when we here know its his cbars doing and that&#x27;s why we can never take them seriously because they don&#x27;t even know who and why there mad, they just mad but they barking at the wrong tree because yeji 2.0 fed them lies.</p>
