      <p>I want to be rational for once...
The real reason why Zeroses are beefing with Ahgases is because of Rosins. Lemme break it down: some rosins posted that they&#x27;ll be voting for got7 so zeroses are pissed.
-ahgases asked bambam to help them promote the voting. zeroses were pissed because they think it&#x27;s unfair since it will draw their fans. he is the most followed kpop soloist in X.
-zb1 won. some ahgases posted that it&#x27;s ok since zb1 will be disbanding anyway. zeroses were mad saying that ahgases were wishing for zb1 to disband (ðŸ˜³)
-while the above is happening, zeroses were directly quoting bambam &amp; being mean then later said that they were just joking
-the fight intensified because rosins were siding with ahgases and zeroses think that they shouldn&#x27;t be doing it because they&#x27;re wishing for zb1 to disband and hao is there
-then bambam replied a laughing emoji on ahgase&#x27;s post about fighting. zeroses were mad saying that he&#x27;s being mean to zb1 (i&#x27;m sorry i don&#x27;t get the correlation)
-he was then told that the post he replied to was about ahgases fight with zeroses so he deleted the emoji post and  apologized. i saw a post saying that he didn&#x27;t say sorry and only apologized (ðŸ˜­)
-bambam deleted the apology post. probably upon checking that zeroses were quoting him with mean captions. calling him pedophile (it was the show&#x27;s mistranslation as per ahgase) and telling him that he should have killed himself.
-ahgases are so mad now because they think that zeroses are too much by directly attacking bambam when they didn&#x27;t do it with zb1 and the only drag they say is disbandment which they find funny because it was ZB1&#x27;s contract. *i do think that rosins should be called out for proudly saying that they&#x27;re voting for got7. then, zeroses should also be called out for directly quoting an artist with mean captions. and ahgases should stop and be the bigger persons. It&#x27;s sad because we ruined a good relationship when dr dr has 0 chance of winning any music show because it has no physical points</p>
