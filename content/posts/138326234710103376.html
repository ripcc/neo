        <p>Redundant topic but as a riyangi I rolled my eyes soooo hard at ppl freaking out over Ricky not being in the Shanghai TikTok, USE YOUR BRAIN PLEASEEEEE do u really think wakeone is in charge of the trolltoks like no the members themselves ask if they can do it. If Ricky wanted to be part of it and wakeone rlly did control who’s in every specific TikTok do you think they’d srsly exclude him for no reason?????? They srsly don’t know him at all like he’s so obviously just keeping to himself rn so to basically force him to post TikTok’s and do all this dumb stuff he dgaf about is so stupid</p>
