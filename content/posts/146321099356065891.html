        <p>&quot;Under the regulations set by the Korea Entertainment Management Association, artists are allowed to contact other agencies or discuss exclusive contracts starting three months before the contract ends.&quot; I wish I knew what type of contract they signed with their original agencies</p>

      <p>Probably.. Bae jinyoung left cix when his contract was up (5 years) and wannaone was 2 years so yep 7 years. Minju (izone) only had a 4 year contract (2018-2022) but maybe because hers is more of an actor company /+r/146304289885871193</p>
