      <p>seriously these people are making me mad. hanbin LOVES baek yerin. allins always talk about him liking nct and jaehyun but when recommending songs especially for those zb1 picks, he almost always moves between nct/jaehyun or baek yerin. listening to her songs right now means nothing when it is apparent he always loved her songs and no, it is not because he is going through a breakup. /+r/138327852629317665</p>
