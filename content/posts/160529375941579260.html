        <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/haobbao/status/1900177721344614549?s=46"></a></blockquote> I know her new weibo account. And she doesn&#x27;t hate Hao, she was calling him cute and was reposting his posts. She makes a lot of troll posts though. Not only about hao but about Hanbin too. Her bias is still Hanbin and she is also a haobin shipper. But she should be careful about what she posts because from what I saw she obviously likes hao but a little crazy about it. Maybe a love hate feeling. But one thing good about her is that she also goes to their fansigns but I haven&#x27;t seen any invasive ship questions or repos from her. She however reposts and talks about other ship repos. She is just a little crazy.</p>

        <p>aroo? So she rlly does have some like for him I thought it was just obsession that took a turn. She obviously doesn&#x27;t care about being careful she operates like a troll I just think people shouldn&#x27;t take her serious or watch what she does it doesn&#x27;t matter nothings stopping her üò≠</p>

      <p>She definitely hates on him with other c-allins it feels like a love-hate obsession but I wonder how it manifested <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/160473934914081319" class="replyLink">/+r/160473934914081319</a></p>
