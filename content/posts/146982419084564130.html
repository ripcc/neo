      <p>idk who any of the members are so idk who the sea one is but their visuals remind me of either 2nd gen (though it might be the makeup/hair for some of them) or nugu ones like they look less polished which is good tbh bc they&#x27;re all kids so it&#x27;d be nuts if they got the karina special (ik that&#x27;s an extreme example bc part of it is aespa&#x27;s concept but still) <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/146305618804955878" class="replyLink">/+r/146305618804955878</a></p>
