        <p>Anon I doubt they begged for an offer if the organiser has been waiting over 2 months to work with him. If itâ€™s something like a magazine these things are usually planned in advance and the lack of response would have had them taking back the offer after getting ghosted for so long. Whatever it was they clearly wanted to work with him. Also imo it makes more sense for them to post on twt rather than Weibo, they are trying to get wakeone to respond to emails so you think twt or Weibo is going to be more effecting in getting their attention? <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/138404601098621581" class="replyLink">/+r/138404601098621581</a></p>
