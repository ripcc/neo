      <p>what this shows is that he is more comfortable singing lower which is the case for everyone honestly and because this isn’t an encore he can actually sing it lower than it actually is without it sounding way too out of place I hope we get a title track that is going to utilize their lower registers wakeone wake up they went viral with run run /+r/156103016632770369</p>
