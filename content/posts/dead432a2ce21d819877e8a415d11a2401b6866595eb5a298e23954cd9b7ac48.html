      <p>Ok I do feel bad for txt, like idk... They just have this tired energy. And the thing is that yeah I know they have been working hard and making comebacks after tours and tours after comebacks, but honestly I feel like it&#x27;s the same for other BGs like Enhypen or 2022-2021 SKZ and they still never give those sick and tired vibes that TXT have been giving lately, their fans are annoying and some members give me the ick but I do feel bad for them and I hope they regain their energy back with this break.</p>
