        <p>Yea fanslots still exist it&#x27;s just not a big thing anymore cuz everyone realized how useless they areeee cuz unless ur doing them CONSISTENTLY it&#x27;s not worth the money to get a fansign experience by proxy ðŸ˜­ ig its only useful to zcs since they wanna get questions/scenarios answered</p>
