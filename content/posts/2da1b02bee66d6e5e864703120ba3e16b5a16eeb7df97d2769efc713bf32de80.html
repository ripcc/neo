      <p>https://x.com/doongeunhae/status/1845188045819056264 went on this person&#x27;s account and they&#x27;re currently doing this thread i&#x27;m ctfu a lil at this bit bc i never saw anything about this on the i-side. also yeah, i don&#x27;t get why everyone&#x27;s ignoring the hannam aspect that k-fans bring up like i-fans keep being like &quot;korean men are rancid! cut their dicks off!&quot; (true) but when these girls, who are korean and thus have direct experience with hannams, say the way he acts/scandals he&#x27;s gotten into very much reminds them of hannams and to at least not blindly defend him, the i-fans just ignore or dismiss it like it&#x27;s not a big deal ðŸ˜­</p>
