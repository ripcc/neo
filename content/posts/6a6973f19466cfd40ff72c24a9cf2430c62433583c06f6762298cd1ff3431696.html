      <p>about last years mama stage, the views are actually not bought and nobody put an ad on it. if you look at the tweet you can see payolasserafim having around 190k views. zb1 having around 76k views around the same time is totally normal. everybody was ignoring the mama awards last year but then decided to check it out. a bunch also start watching the stages after 5-7+ hours because of timezone differences. the fact that zb1 only has around 400k views within a day is bad. zeroses probably watched the performance on twitter and called it a day ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜ª</p>
