        <p><a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/145590484809767557" class="replyLink">/+r/145590484809767557</a>I mean there’s a big difference between believing his manager is working to get jobs for him and believing cj has some hidden plan to push him because of a new secret bg post zb1. I’m still a firm believer that they would have had him mc iland even if his management hadn’t ran the global auditions because he’s already an mc for another mnet show, they know he’s competent and it saved them a lot of time and probably money than having to go look externally to hire an mc. I never understood the bad rep when people act like his management is pushing him to get jobs, like they are his management I’d sure hope they are working hard to get opportunities for him. And why are we acting like his is the only management involved, this whole fandom is well aware yuehua is involved in securing a lot of stuff for Hariboz in China and managing their work there. Why is it bad if Hanbin’s management is doing the same for him 😭 like I don’t understand they don’t work for zb1 they work for him so how are you going to be mad that they are putting in the work for their own artist.  And just to say it finally if this one manager alone was enough to create all this push then your issue isn’t the manager it’s yuehua because their director is an ex cj exec, they collaborated with wakeone for tour merch, their managers work with zb1 like if they still ain’t making moves to get shit done for their own artist that’s their problem 😭 (saying yuehua because whenever his management comes up there’s only 1 section of the fandom that has something to say about it) </p>

        <p>I almost misunderstood your point chndndmsmdm but this is always said out of a place of ignorance it&#x27;s just annoying to see atp. There is clearer and more damning relations between yhz and wkn than there are with the other companies but it&#x27;s always ignored and yea he was getting that mc job no matter what why would they outsource when they have their own mc from a survival show on emca. While it&#x27;s not absurd that his management could help him get jobs but why would they get first pick over the other companies they&#x27;re the newest and one of the smallest. I just think people want something extra to blame other than the fact that wkn chooses to give him his gigs and the push isn&#x27;t coming from an outside source</p>
