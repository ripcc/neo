      <p>I think it’s just spice food because he was eating spicy malatang earlier that day with gv but he’d look good with a little filler. I looked into a lot of pics though and his lips aren’t as paper thin as people make out I think they just over conceal them a lot because when he goes live they just look regular like not big or plump but not paper thin like people make out.</p>

      <p>yea especially if it was earlier that day spicy food isnt doing that it could be overlining even tho i think fillers more likely but even i noticed his lips looked bigger than before so well be able to tell for sure later on</p>
