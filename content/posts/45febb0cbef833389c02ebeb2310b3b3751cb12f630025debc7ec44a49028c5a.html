      <p>hybe girl group curse kinda real like do you remember their first gg they ever debuted under bighit glam and like a few of the members were blackmailing lee byunghun who obviously caused their demise. Now they have issues with every gg under them, le sserafim’s coachella happened, illit made from rigging + all the plagiarism, fromis_9 has seen success this year but are already parting ways and they were largely ignored and excluded during their time there, and we know what’s happening with newjeans</p>
