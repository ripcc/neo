      <p>wow yujin really like deep in they actually do stalk their fansites accounts lolll i think the luckyz boom was also bc they discovered that most of their fans are friends bc i saw yujin acknowledge that fansite friend group (where deep in, pink skies, etc. is in) on fansigns multiple times and went to hao to say hi to them together</p>
