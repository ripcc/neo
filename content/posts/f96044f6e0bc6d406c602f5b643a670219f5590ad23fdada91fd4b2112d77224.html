      <p>I listened to the song and he didn&#x27;t even get a high note that required all that he just had one that&#x27;s too high to me it sounded uncomfortable cuz I can tell he&#x27;s crossing a limit ahyeon screams because she doesn&#x27;t have good vibrato? and her voice is high so I think she can reach the notes but she&#x27;s just not good at it or not supporting it??? I&#x27;m trying to guess here irdk but also her notes require length gunwooks was really small I&#x27;m ngl I didn&#x27;t even notice it 😭😭 it&#x27;s just too high for him its going to sound difficult no matter what I&#x27;m not that knowledgeable either but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a technique thing</p>
