        <p>I mean hanbin doesnâ€™t suprise me he doesnâ€™t go live that often but iirc he seems to be a really early riser anyway so I doubt itâ€™s much effort. Gyuvin got that 6am alarm going tho, or heâ€™s just woken up by hanbin first since they are in the same dorm ðŸ˜‚ <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/144107660319610388" class="replyLink">/+r/144107660319610388</a></p>
