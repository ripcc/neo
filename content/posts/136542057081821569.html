        <p>does anyone else think that ricky has a separate apartment LMFAOO this is something i‚Äôve had in the back of my mind for a long time but after seeing clips from his live today i‚Äôm so sure like... there‚Äôs just NO WAY he‚Äôs been living there for the past 7 months ‚Äúwe have our own rooms now, so i realized, why do i still have to use this small bed? (why would it take him 7 months to realize this.) there&#x27;s absolutely nothing in my room right now. just the floor. (‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è) so when the bed gets here, i&#x27;ll decorate the room nicely.‚Äù How can someone who seems to shop a lot live in a room for almost 2 years and still have no personal belongings in there. Like look at the other members rooms you can tell that they live there no one else has an empty room omfg it makes no sense</p>

        <p>It would be obvious like jwg if he didn&#x27;t live with them and they&#x27;ve clearly said who he&#x27;s with unlike jwg who&#x27;s never mentioned in the roommate discussions and he probably still uses his little bed from when he roomed with gyv so it&#x27;s an empty room. We gotta rmbr they don&#x27;t spend most of their time in rooms like regular people they&#x27;re always traveling and working so there&#x27;s not gonna be personal belongings and especially if half of a shared room was cleared out rky is type B downnnn he&#x27;s not decorating üò≠</p>
