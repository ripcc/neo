      <p>you are so hellbent on calling taerae a fraud and saying he &quot;acts gay&quot; when he mostly gets called gay by fans because of the way he acts as in no not yaoi fanservice the other members do (gyuvin/ricky, matthew/gunwook, hao/hanbin, jw with everyone ðŸ’€). if he wanted to be fake gay he&#x27;d turn up the yaoi fanservice but he barely ever does it&#x27;s just the way he acts lol (flamboyant, sassy etc.) he&#x27;s been like this even during boys planet also if you notice he usually gets more attention when he taps into that &quot;band guy/sunbae&quot; persona so the way he never intentionally stopped acting &quot;flamboyant&quot; when he knows it doesn&#x27;t gain him fans tells me it&#x27;s not something he does for attention lol; he even had to apologise when fans harassed him during ftp era but even then he never stopped being the way he is - also just to end this I don&#x27;t think being sassy and feminine means that he&#x27;s gay you can be that way and still be straight and it&#x27;s not like he ever claimed to be gay (or straight) either</p>
