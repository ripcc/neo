      <p>wakeone does not even have a weibo tho. in yuehuaz cases it makes sense to make noise there since their og company has a ch branch but with the other members it makes no sense to post about it on weibo when wakeone is the one ignoring the company and not the other way around <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140613779137453005" class="replyLink">/+r/140613779137453005</a></p>
