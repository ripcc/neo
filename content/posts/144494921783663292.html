      <p>From what Iâ€™m hearing the person who posted the sc isnâ€™t even in the gc. Someone sent the sc to a solo so theyâ€™d post it. This reminds me of when yujinaoo got exposed for making hb hate tweets on a woongdeondie burner account and then sending them to allin akgaes from he priv account to start fights ðŸ˜­</p>
