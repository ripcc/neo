      <p>starting from least likely jiwoong obviously well obviously if hao goes straight to china post disbandment he wouldnt see them much but i really think that groups coming so hes gonna be up there with the rest honestly i think the others would be fine theyre all gonna be separated for work obviously the clingier members will frequent each other more or whoever theyre closest too and ricky would hang too gyuvin is really his best friend like that shits rlly not a joke wow. and then theyll grow distant with time cuz thats just life but a bond is a bond i moved states to a place where i know no one so i get it i feel like people think long distance and less communication means no relationship thats just not true</p>
