        <p>wait since someone talked about hanbin doing one more year in university something interesting that I found out recently was that taerae used to be in a highly regarded university in a music program that only accepts less than like 30? or 50? people a year - and he dropped out to go to cyber university while being an idol later but damn that was kinda crazy ngl also that he passed an audition for sm ent and was a trainee there for a while</p>
