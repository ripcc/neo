      <p>i actually feel so bad for everglow they had so much potential, their debut did so well and everyone was tuning in for them during their rookie times only for yuehua to abandon them ðŸ˜­ what the hell is that companyâ€™s issue itâ€™s like theyâ€™re purposely making their groups fail didnt they do the same thing with uniq?</p>
