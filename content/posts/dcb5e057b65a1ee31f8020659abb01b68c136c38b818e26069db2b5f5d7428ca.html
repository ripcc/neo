      <p>they kinda had a back and forth taerae didnt have the greatest first impression of gyuvin it was smth stupid ab gyuvin playing with his zippers and he didnt know him so its like who are you even? then the beg arc started a couple months later where gyuvin wasnt rocking w him then it died at that point im like okay seems mutual i guess but taerae was throwing a likkle shade saying gyuvin was going through puberty and for them to ignore each other fr fr in lives i just get the vibe taeraes the villain here but ik someones gonna take this super fucking serious ughhhhhhhhhhh</p>
