        <p>hao wasn&#x27;t given any special performance in korea since last year and mbc gayo is his 1st ever and i&#x27;m still thinking what voodoo he did to get one. Maybe this is sinophobia because you can barely see chinese idols having solo stages in korea. yuqi is a crack in the system and i should thank soyeon for it she loves yuqi the most and believes in her talent. yuqi wasn&#x27;t treated like this because soyeon is the one deciding who to do what. <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/1309081709" class="replyLink">/+r/1309081709</a></p>
