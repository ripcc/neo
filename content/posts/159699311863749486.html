      <p>yall... ppl dont care ab the context intl fans might have defended them but they pack 0 punch but trust me he wouldve been dragged to hell and back by kfans. with how hard zbwon get bullied yall should know the scape by now ðŸ˜­ in general idols are products to their fans so any disrespect for whatever reason is a no no and kfans take that serious if a video of matthew just ignoring a fan came out all possible context is out the window and ppl r gonna run with what they see ex: DINGO like nah he wouldve got tore tf up</p>
