      <p>Please no one do bad omens on me because I hate allins down but if I had seen the context as that op posted it and saw that people were calling my bias a pervert for it I‚Äôd probably crash tf out too. Like queef said that‚Äôs too unprofessional and we all know they play it up for rps fans but even they they still gotta think about what they say. However I will say as a Chinese speaker that the phrase has many meaning and after listening to the context I seriously doubt he meant it in the inappropriate context at all and more of ‚Äúhanbin someone who has a lot of knowledge, knows a lot about certain things‚Äù but not in the sexual context. In that instance the op who reposted all the sexual connotations and mislead other rps fans was the main person doing damage to both of them. /+r/156952013110992000</p>
