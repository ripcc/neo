        <p>My take (it&#x27;s lukewarm) is that of course hao feeds into it he&#x27;s smart and caters to fans and I don&#x27;t feel bad at all for him normally when he&#x27;s answering typical ship questions because he obviously dgaf and will answer. I feel like everyone on here knows that but it&#x27;s still weird for zerocolas to dig for stuff or cross boundaries since he&#x27;ll tell them what they want to hear even without the leading questions. Like asking him what he would do if his phone gallery got hacked is crazy work that&#x27;s when I feel for the dude. Two things can be true at once, he&#x27;s good at feeding shippers and the questions are getting weirder <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160128297517404787" class="replyLink">/+r/160128297517404787</a></p>
