        <p>i think its hao too but thats cause he has the biggest fandom so wide range of fans but imo its not gonna hit him as much as ricky and hanbin who&#x27;s half the fandom is consist of only that and tbh if hao stays with yuehua they are just gonna find another target ðŸ˜­ <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160847502227234609">/160847502227234609</a></p>

        <p>imo haos fandom is similar as well he has the larger fandom so automatically larger influx of fans who participate for the rage but its rlly not a huge proportional difference. cuz no shade rosinism has been built on schizobabble just as much as allinsim and riyangism if not more ðŸ˜­ hell retain a lot of those fans if he redebuts in yh quick enough but that could be more negative than losing them</p>

      <p>Thereâ€™s another thing with hao tho like not all but you have to realise there is a portion of fans who stan him solely because heâ€™s the groups most popular and the center. When he moves to another group or solo Iâ€™d say heâ€™s at bigger risk of most fan loss (he will still have a lot of fans) simply because some are just here for the position and wonâ€™t admit it till itâ€™s gone. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/161008309334398618">/161008309334398618</a></p>

      <p>right they exist they dont have to be a majority but theres gonna be huge fan loss just like every member of the group. his position of center def made him gain more of those clouty fans so the risk is there</p>
