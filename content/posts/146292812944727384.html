      <p>people keep saying survival shows has been a thing since forever i remember everyone shitting on zeroses and zb1 when someone made a post about zb1&#x27;s impact BUT ITS LITERALLY TRUE zb1 was like a gem a miracle how the contestants made it interesting other than that their hugeeee success their first pre order reaching million in like only 6 hrs a record that will never be broken and them being highest revenue 5th gen bg rn maybe above some other gens too, the boys definitely swimming in the money ðŸ˜­ like the impact is there idc!!! zb1 might&#x27;ve not been bigger as wannaone in terms of popularity but the money is times bigger than them and that&#x27;s what companies care about, mnet aiming for chinese market for b2p and im surprised sm doesn&#x27;t do chinese members anymore i don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single on on the new bg and there&#x27;s non in the smngg either, before every single group had chinese members ever since lsm left its been like that, new sm is aiming for the sea and that&#x27;s good for stability just look at yg they run sea</p>

      <p>the thing is I got both sides of the argument actually I sided with zroses more but it sounded like it comes from a place of mmmm ignorance? (idk what other word to use cuz this is definitely not that serious to say this lol) because they&#x27;re majority new kpop fans so it didn&#x27;t translate well. but they&#x27;re right when you put it into perspective zbwon are technically the produce bg after wannaone which is so crazy to think about THEY REVIVED SOMETHING IN KPOP THAT WE HAVENT SEEN IN AGES AND THEY MAKE THE MOST SAY THATTTTTTTT everyone&#x27;s been taking a piece of their nachos and we&#x27;re gonna see big4 trying their method once they&#x27;re gone</p>
