      <p>See cbar alone I could dismiss but his dcgall getting heated and involved too even giving more info about how far along they were makes me believe it. Dcgall never really get involved in anything like this so why would they suddenly lie about a random China schedule when the fandom in general has never expressed or pushed for jobs in that market prior. /+r/138203326574710967</p>
