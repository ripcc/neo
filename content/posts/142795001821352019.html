        <p>Dream (nightmare?) I had. I don&#x27;t think wakeonez will debut assuming the new bp group is also under wakeone. They&#x27;ll probably sell off their contracts or transfer them to klap. They&#x27;ll keep taerae and make him into jaehwan 2.0. Worst-case is them staying at jellyfish and gunwook debuting with them. Anyways wakeone cannot handle multiple groups that&#x27;s why they moved kep1er once izna debuted and disbanded to1 when they got zb1</p>
