      <p>it looks like you don&#x27;t need to to quote on there but the interface is just too different to get behind so don&#x27;t worry about it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll move unless it&#x27;s super pressing here or if majority end up liking mond more. Moving is so annoying it took hair pulling to get yall to like ns when i first came gjjdnfnnfmdmdm</p>
