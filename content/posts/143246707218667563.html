        <p>Not to be this person but you get only a little taste of the shit us haobinists have to deal withâ€¦ not meaning that in a bad way just meaning like the annoying ass stuff/death threats you have to see and hear is what we hear non stop. We canâ€™t even say one thing about them without getting shat on like damn. Never understood why rosins/allins are so pressed like live your own life stop coming into ours. Also as a haobinist myself, a lot of haobinists are indeed annoying asfâ€¦ but Iâ€™ve never seen a hbinist go into another ships Neo/ot9 Neo and spam people who donâ€™t ship Haobin to kill themselvesâ€¦</p>
