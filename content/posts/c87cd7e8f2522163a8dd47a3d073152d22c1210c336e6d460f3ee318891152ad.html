      <p>I find the recent flack interesting because I don&#x27;t think anything&#x27;s out of the ordinary? In fact these conversations are so obviously lighter and in a more positive direction than before. The exact same things would be said back on curiouscat and even before both aestasmoon and chanelcrocs went from anons here to their own page handlers. It&#x27;s definitely a sight to see I&#x27;ve been here for a long time I don&#x27;t send asks often but I can at least attest to your consistency on opinions and handling your page. Not sure why things get so inflammatory so quickly, well I do, but it&#x27;s still pretty jarring to see I think it&#x27;s best to just refrain from it all together it&#x27;s not your fault if sensitivity blinds people from reading.</p>
