      <p>They jumped her bad and were talking shit on dc but honestly it wasn&#x27;t that crazy of a ratio maybe it worse since she has an actual rep. idt the intention was for her to leave or maybe it was but yea looks like there&#x27;s gonna be a disconnect cris and rukidans on twt never seemed to get along tbh</p>
