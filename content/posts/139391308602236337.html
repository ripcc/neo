        <p>No sis I hear you I feel like they&#x27;re looked down on for being from a survival show and debuting under a low midtier agency üòí they&#x27;re a force to be reckoned with when it comes to stats but they&#x27;re never praised or acknowledged even when they had the ultimate buzz we only got a couple artists singing to in bloom and shit like wow I had to thank baekhyun for the first time in my life. also byun wooseok does tricks on the riice dick but zbwon have actually covered a song from his show AND performed with him on the stage but he ain&#x27;t say a damn thing about them like ughhhhh it&#x27;s unfair my meows they&#x27;re all alone</p>
