        <p>someone said ytd that it&#x27;s probably for 2d1n filming (is it you who said this or anon, req i forgot), i kinda agree bc on the last episode they&#x27;re talking about filming overseas in ricky&#x27;s house in LA, but ig it&#x27;s too far and expensive so they just stick in asia <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/138406525889896308" class="replyLink">/+r/138406525889896308</a></p>

      <p>they will be there for 6 days and to return on 22nd isnâ€™t that too long for a 2d1n content? the mv filming makes sense but ngl i hope it was for 2d1n too <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/138407841328486300" class="replyLink">/+r/138407841328486300</a></p>
