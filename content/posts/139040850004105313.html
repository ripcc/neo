      <p>the thing about males doing super high parts isn&#x27;t even that it&#x27;s difficult to do or if they&#x27;re doing it wrong it just sounds jarring no matter what that&#x27;s honestly what happened with the ricky ftp draggings because he was literally singing in the exact right key that song is originally in but anyways I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re winning on any shows with no physical points because the easiest to win shows show champion and the show are on hiatus till feb and the other shows its only possible if they&#x27;re topping the melon charts or something but honestly let&#x27;s hope a miracle happens and they hit it big yassss mcountdown inkigayo musiccore winssss <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/139034588214416171" class="replyLink">/+r/139034588214416171</a></p>
