      <p>such a stale topic but seeing side by sides and old content in the present will really gag me every time. the kpopzempic really has them in such a chokehold like i particularly miss hanbin&#x27;s more fuller face which u see from a year ago and he was already skinny as fuck back then but idk clearly he and the members are a lost cause like it is what it is ðŸ˜” for some reason with hao it was less obvious to me, i think bc he already has such a skinny frame, but this video is crazy wtf who is that!!!!!!!??!?!?!?!?!?</p>
