      <p>Something happened for sureeeee like the 180 is so funny and we talked about it a bit ago I forget which group live it was but an anon pointed out how avoidant they were ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it just reminds me of when taerae didn&#x27;t rlly like gyuvin at first so it&#x27;s kinda not surprising they seem like they&#x27;d class tbh</p>
