      <p>Sorry this sounds so much like the Hybe bootlickers on reddit who are saying this is &quot;normal&quot; and claim that the document was a sentiment analysis report. This isn&#x27;t normal at all, especially for a company report; It&#x27;s not just some texts or something from a group chat where it&#x27;s maybe ok to be less professional. It&#x27;s one thing to analyze the competition and note strengths and weaknesses, but another to outright slander other groups and make weird comments about minors.</p>
