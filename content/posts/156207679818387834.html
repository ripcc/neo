YouTube was zhang hao only for a good two hours until allins saw the zhg post and copied it. I was so mad because people were cursing the fuck out of zhang hao in the comments for &quot;chinese commenting team&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t ever pick this guy because his fandom is crazy&quot; and &quot;xi jinping&quot; bullshit when it was international fans commenting and then once all of the other zb1 fandoms got here they never attacked them even though hanbin&#x27;s fans were also acting like bots they just hate chinese people. It was so bad that kfans were telling rosins to stop posting. </p>
