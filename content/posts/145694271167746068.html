I&#x27;m sorry Hao ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Just thinking back at all their interactions and icl hanbin vibes with them so much more I dig this line up too </p>

        <p>BVNNDNDMDMDM I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;ve debated between which to add for the lineup I think hbn just matches the most he&#x27;s closer to most of them than zgh so it makes sense</p>
