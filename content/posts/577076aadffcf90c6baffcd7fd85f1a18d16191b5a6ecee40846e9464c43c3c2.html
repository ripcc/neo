      <p>A bit random but I was deeping the zb1 contract and I think one smart way they could move forward is do what x1 were supposed to do and have their solo stuff managed by their og companies ( im sure most of it is anyway) but I think having wakeone strictly manage only the group stuff would be better</p>

      <p>hmmmm I feel like that has so many holes and would&#x27;ve turned into a shitshow we just never got to see what it would&#x27;ve looked like on x1 it failed with ioi and we already know only half the group have actual prospects</p>
