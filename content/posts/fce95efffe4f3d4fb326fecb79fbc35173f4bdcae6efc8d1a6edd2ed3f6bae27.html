      <p>https://neospring.org/+r/9f951dceb4 It’s a cooking show but the name is like backpack smth. It’s a spin off of jinnis kitchen iirc that show taehyung was on that they filmed in latam. The one Matthew is on has that really famous kr chef on it too. I feel like it’s an open secret in this fandom that he’s on it and he even said in his live today he recommends the show and basically gave away that he’s appearing on it without directly saying it which is why I’m wondering where anon heard hao from because there’s nothing that has suggested hao was in that schedule too</p>
