        <p>i agree about matty but gunwook???? boy doesn&#x27;t even get jobs and only guesting in &lt;30mins youtube shows. backpacker put matty as first name making him the only one getting it all while gunwook get nothing even though, imo he carry the whole song. they were bitter about ppusamz and keep fighting seokryus whenever he hangs out with jwg, now matty stay away from him suddenly its mattparkz being pushed??? <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/155496921086251310" class="replyLink">/+r/155496921086251310</a></p>

      <p>honestly weird bc they actually never fucked with mtw in the first place except like 20% of them their kfans were borderline harassing him during 2023 for the duo bc they did not want him interacting with jiwoong and there are tweets up too and then there is another duo that they prefer, their international side was always 50-50 and majority of pusamzers was also seokryudans in the first place?? <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/155537419024947150" class="replyLink">/+r/155537419024947150</a></p>
