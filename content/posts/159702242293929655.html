        <p>Ong and thatâ€™s the thing I understand not bringing up some things especially from when he was way younger but rosins act like he deleted these things ages ago when most his socials were deleted like a month after he git revealed as a bp triangle meaning people found them all when he was a public figure and some of his socials are still out there and public (he deffo forgot the password) like yeah our fandom wonâ€™t talk about it but if those things are still public and out there other fandoms eventually will. Thatâ€™s lowkey how 8 stars found so much in their fight because they didnâ€™t even have to dig that far ðŸ˜­ <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/159689788490997581">/159689788490997581</a></p>
