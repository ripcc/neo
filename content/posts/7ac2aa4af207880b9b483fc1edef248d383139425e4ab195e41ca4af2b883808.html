      <p>“ The title song &quot;NOW OR NEVER&quot; is a new original Japanese song that combines drums and bass with rock sounds, and features an emotional piano and energetic guitar sound. It is a song with a sad message that &quot;Even though we are apart, I have come back with the feeling that I will always be with you.&quot;” The message 💔💔 it already sounds promising from the description though</p>
