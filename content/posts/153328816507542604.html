      <p>Ykw from an outside perspective (not any of these sf Iâ€™m about to mention) I always thought there would be 1 whoâ€™d make it hard to carry on but itâ€™s not yh. Even with the way duhua talked about zb1 including not her own members makes it clear the company knows the value of having a hand in that group and to be completely honest zb1 is more successful with 4 yhz in it that any group yh has ever produced and they themselves know post disbandment no one is guaranteed success. Like anon said itâ€™s a way more stable form of income to keep them in the group even if they negotiate for more management rights ect. There is a members whose company I think definitely wonâ€™t resign and thatâ€™s based on what Iâ€™ve heard here about their actions but each can make their own judgement on who that is because maybe Iâ€™m perceiving that differently too. Overall I think the group could continue with less members like the article said but if definitely wonâ€™t be with half the yhz gone and it would be fully dependent on who those members are. /+r/152834309139683065</p>
