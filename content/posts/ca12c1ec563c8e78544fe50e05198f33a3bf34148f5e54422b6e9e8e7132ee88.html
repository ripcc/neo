      <p>yeah he looks SOOO much happier, probably even the happiest he&#x27;s been and u can tell in their performances, bts zepisodes, group lives, solo lives etc. like he&#x27;s always joking and being cute with the members but ig to noyb and her minions hes depressed because he didnt say &#x27;im happy&#x27; on pchat.... just pissed me off cause we all know why noyb shared that ris fancall but when it didnt go her way she deleted it like a bitch and for that ris to tell ricky in his face he seems lifeless on stage (basically) how are riyangis not calling that ris out ðŸ˜­ ricky literally says he does everything for the stage and the stage is where he&#x27;ll show his results from all his hard work cause hes not the type to talk about it, he literally practices right until he goes up on stage u see it all the time on zepisodes and op called him lifeless, lost his sparkles ðŸ˜­ i bet if it was about his makeup riyangis would tweak</p>

      <p>like NFNNDNDMDM IF ANYTHING HES OPENED UP SHE DONT EVEN KNOW HIS TEA FR I can&#x27;t imagine she&#x27;s actually a fan of him there&#x27;s no way an agenda is this important or the misinterpretation goes this far. I&#x27;m surprised too since that&#x27;s rude af but I mean look at the state of Twitter riyangis.. AND LMAOOO THEY WOULD IVE NEBER SEEN PEOPLE BAT BEHIND UGLY MAKEUP SO HARD</p>
