      <p>srry im gonna be a negative nancy but if I was an idol and my relevancy was only because of a duo ship I would actually end it 😭 I mean half these shippers gonna follow and haunt them even after the group and terrorize their next members or peers and the other half gonna dip. srry I just have vkook trauma</p>

      <p>I can already here the annoying fans thatre gonna trickle in thinking you mean total relevancy MI NOT REPLYING DONT CAREEEE 😂✌️ but yea their duo contributes so much to them and it usually doesn&#x27;t fair well in the long run but they&#x27;re temporary so i think it&#x27;ll be okay for now and I don&#x27;t think at this point it would get out of hand if definitely had the potential to before but that&#x27;s been squashed</p>
