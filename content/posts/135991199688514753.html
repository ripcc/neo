      <p>I&#x27;m going to as many as I can so far I&#x27;ve already gone to two but no you purchase a drink or snack at the cafe and get goodies and then you can do lucky draw for $2000won and get a range of things I just won a huge frame üòù idk how it works outside of Korea cuz I&#x27;ve never been But I guess that&#x27;s the gist</p>
