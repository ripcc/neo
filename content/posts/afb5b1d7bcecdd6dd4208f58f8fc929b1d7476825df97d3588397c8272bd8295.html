      <p>PINNED here&#x27;s a simple guide to markdowns https://commonmark.org/help/ if you have any suggestions you can hit up the main developer @spark# turn on automatic anonymous in account settings for now and maybe forever threads will be used in the form of links, which is doable it&#x27;s not that hard lol its better to show some of the previous ask if its too long cut it! clicking thread links and clicking back does refresh your page so to avoid that long click (by holding) and open links in different tabs well use comments on asks for additional context but for the purpose of a thread it doesnt work, trust me yall i tested it out ðŸ˜­ I&#x27;ll continue to operate the same there&#x27;s perks to this site that cc didn&#x27;t have that we&#x27;ll learn along the way, for example I can create private inboxes and hand select users to join creating a circle where I can answer things that would not be made public don&#x27;t be a party pooper cc was shitty but we managed and let&#x27;s have fun yay</p>
