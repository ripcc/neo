      <p>I know nothing about those two uncs but the theme for the show was old x new gen and the choreo was the same as when the two uncs did it when they were younger. If it makes you feel better I saw some screenshots of the two uncs closing their eyes when they were near her so I think it&#x27;s was okay, it was just a performance and she got a good response too üôÇ‚ÜïÔ∏è /+r/c30910848a</p>
