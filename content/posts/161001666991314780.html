        <p>since idols are considered contractors and not employees these companies are able to get away with so much. Their contract must suck because touring and university festivals pay so well. yuehua probably has some bs clause where everything is an expense so they&#x27;re in a neverending cycle of debt. like that girl from momoland said stage outfits were part of her expenses <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160517951630561674">/160517951630561674</a></p>

      <p>i think they meant in the way that idols are contractors and the staff are the workers. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160540095764715823">/160540095764715823</a></p>
