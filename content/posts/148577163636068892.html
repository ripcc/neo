        <p>the mattbinrae unit is toooooooo good like iâ€™m personally v excited for that but lowkey they shouldâ€™ve made the units more balanced talent wise bc why is hao with both gyuvin AND jiwoong. they shouldâ€™ve had one member from each of these tiers for each unit: main vocals (taerae, hao, hanbin - i donâ€™t think hbâ€™s an Actual main vocal but out of all members heâ€™s arguably 3rd best. u could swap gunwook for his place if u wanted), lead vocals (gunwook, matthew, ricky) and sub vocals (yujin, jiwoong, gyuvin) so eg a possible unit could be taerae, gunwook and yujin. hope it sounds good regardless but they apparently have someone who has worked with skz on the track so ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
