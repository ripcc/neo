      <p>jiwoong- don&#x27;t pay attention
hao- mix of eye contact or straight up ignoring
hanbin- he has more of a resting cute face? Ik that&#x27;s not has natural face but he holds that also ngl I don&#x27;t watch his vids much
taerae- I&#x27;ve probably seen like 5 taerae vids max but you can really tell what he&#x27;s thinking on his face matthew- ngl if someone was talking to him in english all up in his space he&#x27;d probably talk back ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ that&#x27;s just the vibe I get but I don&#x27;t see him do much from the federal vids I come across
Ricky- face on at all times regardless of which type of fan but he blatantly ignores ssngs
gyuvin- I&#x27;ve seen kssng? that was at the busan pick site with them and I&#x27;m not even kidding she took a picture of gyuvin less than a foot away from him and he was just looking at her his boundaries just seem a lot looser
gunwook- has a pretty intense stare ngl he&#x27;s rlly good at giving interactions but it&#x27;s usually towards fans the federal vids are just ignoring he&#x27;s the type to reply if u say smth to him tho
Yujin- ignores everyone I&#x27;m trying to just base this off of the videos I see on xhs not everything I see is from sasaengs it&#x27;s more invasive fans and it really depends on the day, how they feel, what the specific person says or does, if they&#x27;re a regular or not, location, etc like it all depends. That&#x27;s just my observation they definitely recognize their sasaengs and frequent fans and they&#x27;ll treat them accordingly. anyone else can add what they&#x27;ve observed</p>
