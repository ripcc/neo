      <p>Who got the biggest schlong in the group (no ❌ Yujin)? Gyuvin (tall af, big hands, it’d be slender but insanely long) Hanbin (sleeper agent; I’ve seen his fancams he’s got a knocker in there y’all just don’t know it like I do) Gunwook (you see how thick is neck is? It’d be long AND wide + big hands) Hao (standard but old is gold) Ricky (he actually has smaller hands than most people realize but he’s still tall; he’d be standard) Jiwoong (😒) Matthew (barely bigger than Taerae, but he’d be good af at using it) Taerae (not micro at all but also right below average; small and short legs)</p>
