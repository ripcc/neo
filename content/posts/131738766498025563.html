      <p>https://x.com/shenfraisinette/status/1872816482926903377?s=46 As a big lesbo I see it. The only one that don’t look like a lesbian is Jiwoong and that’s due to his big old chin. Gunwook has feminine facial features (even if his body as stereotypically masculine). Put a good wig on all of them except gramps, do their make up well, and get them good clothing and they could be lesbians 😏💅🥰 ohhhh bisexuals and pansexuals are truly blessed here, my cheerful looking butches 🥰🥰🥰😍😘</p>
