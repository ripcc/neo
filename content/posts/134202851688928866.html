      <p>This actually changes perspective for me a little, because as much as rosins and other yuehua fans wanna deny it anyone with eyes knows yuehua is extremely involved with wakeone / zb1 and i do think of this is true and they are going to manage the new bg they will actually be ok with a contract extension because they will have their own source of income through the bg in China and a steady source of income from their zb1 yuehuaz in korea <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/134019647182950519">/134019647182950519</a></p>
