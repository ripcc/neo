        <p>ricky fans are so fucking stupid the reason ricky isn&#x27;t posting anything about katokato is because the fanmeeting was a mess and kato violated a ton of things they contractually promised the 100 winning fans for it who spent a LOT of money to get in. kato put him up in a hotel that&#x27;s literally 100 dollars a night and sngs immediately found it, it was supposed to be a private event and kato made it 100% public and invited random influencers who got treated better than the winners it&#x27;s extremely hush hush but the winners of the event have their own chat room now where they&#x27;re suing kato so of course ricky isn&#x27;t going to post about it</p>
