      <p>Actually the main fight is under the #邵子恒 塌房＃tag. This person isn’t trying to insert themselves into the fight they are trying to fight shippers by saying hao is into other men not hanbin and if you go into their account I’m 99% sure they ship yeonjun and hanbin 😭 they probably saw the pics blowing up in the fight and thought it would annoy shippers especially since callins are pissed at that shipper at the fanmeet to since it involved hanbin in something they didn’t want him anywhere near</p>
