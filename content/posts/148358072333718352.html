        <p>somehow funny to think back to the members all saying on tape that hao and taerae are the main vocalists in the group yet it&#x27;s haobin being the top 2 in lines for every single song 😭 they even went to lee mujin before tr did and both got an ost before tr as well like just say haobin are the main vocalists then 😞</p>
