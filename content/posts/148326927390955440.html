        <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/googieiand/status/1888255931470762457?s=46"></a></blockquote> At first I was getting super annoyed he was eating like that 😒 like super annoyed 😑 but then I thought about the fact he has that chin implant and maybe it’s genuinely a little uncomfortable or painful when he opens his mouth fully. Belle does the same thing, and moves her chin in the same sort of unnatural way and looks uncomfortable when she opens her mouth fully. I’ve never had a chin implant so I can’t speak 100% on it but it wouldn’t shock me if it’s a little weird to fully open your mouth with it, especially with chin implants that are that big or don’t fit exactly well. The skin is stretched over the extra protruding part, so it makes sense it’s a little tight idk 🤷‍♀️</p>

      <p>i heard with jaw shaving and chin implants u can lose nerves to ur bottom jaw / chin so maybe thats why he chewing so werid cuz he aint got no lower jaw nerves and has to use upper jaw nerves to compensate <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/146986014412592349" class="replyLink">/+r/146986014412592349</a></p>
