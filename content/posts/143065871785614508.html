      <p>I mean nobody said he&#x27;s evil spirited ðŸ˜­ but people need to stop acting like the dude is dumb or naive lmao he literally has a degree in kpop and studied this idol shit down to a t he knows what he&#x27;s doing he&#x27;s a pr genius, he always says he&#x27;s always trying to build connections for himself in the industry so yeah he&#x27;s obviously a nice person but he isn&#x27;t dumb, I remember when he was posted on SUPADUPAMY for always trying to chase clout with hybe idols after posting pics with shinyu and ignoring that nugu idol who did the perfume collab with them hdhdbdndjjdjdhdjdj /+r/142816802332955155</p>
