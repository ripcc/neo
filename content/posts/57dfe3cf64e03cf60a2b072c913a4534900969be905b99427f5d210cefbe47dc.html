      <p>https://x.com/meow_jw0209/status/1867050133030048070 I never understood what theses overlaying images are supposed to prove, that they photoshopped it? But if it&#x27;s him of coarse his face gonna look the same if it&#x27;s at the same angle ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Oh I went through this persons acc I think they&#x27;re a sunghoon solo cuz they&#x27;re dunking on jungwon and posting a bunch of shit from weibo the post basically reads as showing the feature similarities not that it&#x27;s photoshopped like you could say that&#x27;s jungwon even tho it&#x27;s hard to see cuz that&#x27;s how his profile looks. I need to read their spin tho they said they knew an acquaintance of jungwons in one of their tweets??</p>
