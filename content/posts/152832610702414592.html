        <p>ngl I kinda was hoping for a tomboyz unit song bc they just kinda match energies....like looking at this tiktok they posted, they felt the most in sync and just as a trio I feel like they&#x27;d mesh well together esp. since they&#x27;ve worked together before <a href="https://twitter.com/kyoonghug/status/1893512456288243900">https://twitter.com/kyoonghug/status/1893512456288243900</a></p>

      <p>in wildlife terms, those three are apex predators from different ecosystems. they are strong but if they are together at least one gotta die before the fight even start <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/152266133737789331">/152266133737789331</a></p>
