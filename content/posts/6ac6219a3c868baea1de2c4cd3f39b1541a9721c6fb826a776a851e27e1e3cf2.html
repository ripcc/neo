      <p>they are clinging on to his old bubble messages for dear lifeeee like he was more active then but it was clearly the novelty of it all. after seeing the screenshots of the crazy messages ris would send I wouldn’t blame him for wanting to avoid that and becoming less active. this is the same guy who said he takes ages to film a tiktok challenge because he’s so strict with himself and also said he’s more lax about taking pictures with the members compared to solo shots since he cares a lot about his image and how he comes across when he’s on his own. it’s like these people don’t know his personality /+r/29a6e2dc24</p>
