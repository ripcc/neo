        <p>ive giving us another mid comeback like they are still darlings in korea but internationally they’ve def fallen off, their last comeback to really make an impact was I AM but things started going downhill with baddie and they still haven’t bounced back from it. the songs just aren’t it they need to let ryan jhun go</p>
