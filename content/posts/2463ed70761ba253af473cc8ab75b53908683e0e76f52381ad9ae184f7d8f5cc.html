      <p>i&#x27;ve always been curious about what his degree entails like there&#x27;s predebut videos of him where they had to dance and sing to these kpop mashups and there&#x27;s one where he made tutting and waacking choreography to a blackpink song but is that really all. like when u go on the wikipedia it just says &#x27;department of kpop performance&#x27; but i do wonder if they learn the behind the scenes of the industry. during the bp finale when they all filmed vlogs there was one part of his where he was sitting in this lecture theatre but idk wtf he would&#x27;ve been learning if it was solely on performance or not, maybe the theory of it lmao</p>
