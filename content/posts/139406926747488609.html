        <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/hbmewz/status/1880980207710158902"></a></blockquote> If this tweet is about Hao since he just went live, then he is greedy(this person might be exaggerating since it is from an allin). Gunwook said every member got good satisfying parts, so I assume everyone got similar amount of lines that could showcase their singing, even the ones who are bad at singing. I know some don&#x27;t deserve it but still it could be encouraging for the members who&#x27;ve always had the least lines.</p>
