      <p>Why u sound like an anti? &quot;He loves his sasaengs down&quot;??? Okay you can disagree with apologizing in a vague way but I&#x27;m pretty sure the logical conclusion should be it&#x27;s because he doesn&#x27;t want it to spark too much discussion about the issue which being direct can do. What do you want him to say? I&#x27;m not fucking a sasaeng just because I visited a gallery that most of my fans also visited? He addressed the issue which is favoritism and that&#x27;s that. /+r/1307668184</p>
