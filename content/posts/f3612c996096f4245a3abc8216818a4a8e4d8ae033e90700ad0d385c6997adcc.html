      <p>Why do hariboz&#x27; stans still keep to be surprised by special weibo content like HaoHao good times/ Young &amp; Ricky? Exclusive content for chinese/japanese fans isn&#x27;t new concept in kpop
Korean members aren&#x27;t even promoted outside the group (except yujin) in China, even their wb lives were deleted unlike hariboz&#x27; ones but their fans keep crying every time</p>

      <p>Perpetual poverty, I can give it to riyangis more but its just the fact that wakeones so inconsistent in what they do they probably don&#x27;t expect it since it&#x27;s always erratic or spontaneous. haohao good times was poorly planned and to get rosins to calm down honestly lmao</p>
