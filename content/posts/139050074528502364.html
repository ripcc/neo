All Iâ€™ll say because requeef doesnâ€™t like Haobin talk much, is the pfp to Hanbin multiple times after it being blank through college (seeing said pics myself and hao confirmed during a mass crash out between their solosâ€¦ bruh it was crazy) and then calling Hanbin his true first love (came from same op who said the pfp rumor.) thereâ€™s tons of other things that I canâ€™t talk aboutâ€¦ but that in itself is very clear thereâ€™s at least romantic feelings involved. Iâ€™ve seen/heard lots of akgaes trying to start something about them with other people or bring up their past but itâ€™s always been proven wrong/unreliable. Theyâ€™re just mad straight girls who donâ€™t have a chance with their bias. </p>
