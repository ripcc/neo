      <p>bruh this just makes it worse like you&#x27;re literally stereotyping the queer community as if the straight community isn&#x27;t WORSE with this type of shit. idc about haobin or whatever you think their relationship is or even about hao and hanbin all that much but this is getting too fucking far and it&#x27;s hurtful. and i just KNOW youre a straight woman anon get the fuck out of here this is so horrid</p>

      <p>huh how was this hurtful? And when I say I&#x27;m speaking from experience I mean it with my own relationships and those around me it&#x27;s just less likely that my straight friends would remain ACTUAL friends with people they&#x27;ve dated or messed with rather than me or anyone else I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s bad and personally I wasn&#x27;t touching on hookup culture just discussing the POSSIBILITY of a break up and what it could look like yall get too serious this is why we gotta convo switch again. but this sitch just reminds me of the entire changmin soobin keonhee fiasco lollllllllll anyways anon corrected themselves and said it did sound bad but it&#x27;s not hard to see what they meant ðŸ˜­ like my bad if this struck a nerve</p>
