      <p>I&#x27;m quite shocked at how new all these people arguing with you are it&#x27;s probably because of the other haobin NS. But I didn&#x27;t think haobin fans moved in their own kind of group entitlement, shocking. Im sorry to them, but they probably have no idea how your page runs or the fact that you&#x27;re the reason a lot of people turned towards anonymous forum like pages for zb1 and haobin. I still don&#x27;t get the outrage it was a total of 2 asks answered with no real importance among 50+ other asks this is heading towards a familiar road ðŸ’€ just wanted to share that because it&#x27;s always new anons that ruin everything.</p>
