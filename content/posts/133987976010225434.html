      <p>Bae is really pretty, I think some people just don&#x27;t see it at all bc their MUA loves giving her those blue/green contacts and she has blonde hair on top of that while also being pale and imo that washes her a bit (similar opinion I had on Ricky). But when they stop giving her those contacts, she looks amazing.</p>
