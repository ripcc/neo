      <p>Ok so she’s aoa jimins older sister, has worked for cj since at least 2022 (probably before that but that’s a definite date I could find) is part of the music ip marketing team (might have changed roles as this is 2022 info). It seems like the team she works with isn’t directly under wakeone but rather cj because they have labelled themselves as under cj not wakeone. Someone else from the same team has the same planner/marketer in her bio so I’m guessing that’s her role. So she’s on the marketing team which would explain why she’s at all these events if she’s on marketing.</p>
