        <p>Shippers are so funny when they get triggered by a random troll like this and start talking like they know it all and everyone else is clueless omg üò≠ girl if ur so secure in ur ship why r u crashing out cuz of obvious rage bait that even antis don&#x27;t believe..
I find it so interesting that haobinists never talk about how hanbin only ever mentions gyuvin when he talks about the member he turns to when he&#x27;s having a hard time, the one who&#x27;s always helping him and being there for him, how he&#x27;s always suggesting other members kiss each other including hao and so much other shit that I won&#x27;t even get into like damn if they were fr dating that shit is embarrassing asffffff. Tbh us normal stans/ non haobinists really don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re dating or not all the ships are the same to us the only thing that gives these haobinists the nerve or the confidence is because both of them gay and play into that ship fanservice a lot. Ur also no different (even worse) than delusional gf stans or antis/akgaes who say they hate each other the way you keep trying to make it sound like some gospel truth unknown to everyone but yourselves when u get ur &quot;resources&quot; from sasaeng content and misinformation girl PLEEZ ur on the same internet as everyone else and ur a fan just like everyone else u aren&#x27;t their friend. u sound corny as hell we been in kpop for a while and we know how most kpop popular ships end.
I&#x27;d like to see ur reactions fr when they no longer acknowledge each other after disbandment LMAOOO
Anyway sorry for the rant I just needed to whack haobinists for a sec because they&#x27;ve been irking me for a hot minute especially talking shit about other ships üòÇ (normal shippers this isn&#x27;t about y&#x27;all) <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/143072307076881182" class="replyLink">/+r/143072307076881182</a></p>
