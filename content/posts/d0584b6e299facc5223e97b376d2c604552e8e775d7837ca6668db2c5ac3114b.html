      <p>Wk1 has started slacking again. the fliter they used on these concept photo is so annoying. their is no creative team in that company. even i would be able to do a much better job, at least taerae, matthew, jiwoong&#x27;s photo look better angle wise but one of hanbin&#x27;s has a weird angle, his lip looks so weird and hao&#x27;s face looks too small frame-wise. yura yura was so good but everything about this album feels so rushed. even izna&#x27;s mv looks too empty. what exactly are they doing in that place</p>
