      <p>I genuinely wonder why they havenâ€™t been invited like even outside of what akgaes may try and say about doing something from a members company or the logistics it makes no sense that basically every other 5th gen bg has gone and zb1 hasnâ€™t. Like Iâ€™ll just assume wakeone said no because i genuinely donâ€™t think theyâ€™d invite all these bgs and not the one their own artist is in. /+r/153341989386149107</p>
