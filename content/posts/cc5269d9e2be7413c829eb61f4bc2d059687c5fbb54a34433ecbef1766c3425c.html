      <p>hmmmm nah I don&#x27;t think so his dad has some important business there (we have a theory he actually works somewhere else like Las Vegas/Texas since that&#x27;s where most Californian businessmen go) and if they made the efforts to immigrate I don&#x27;t see the point in going back. I&#x27;m pretty sure to get a green card as a Chinese immigrant there&#x27;s only two ways you either have to invest into America or apply for a work visa (student visas also and family reunification) I think they most likely invested it&#x27;s the faster process so I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re planning for a long life there his sister would def pursue uni here too</p>
