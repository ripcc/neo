      <p>SAMEEE I thought it was just me but matt seems a bit sad? I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s 50/50 because I usually judge it based off their activeness, if they&#x27;re overly active from their usual it&#x27;s either they&#x27;re really happy/ inspired and just want to express their thanks or they&#x27;re lowkey depressed and using social media/ lives to distract themselves from their feelings and i&#x27;ve been feeling the latter with matt ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ But what about you? why do you feel this way ğŸ‘€</p>
