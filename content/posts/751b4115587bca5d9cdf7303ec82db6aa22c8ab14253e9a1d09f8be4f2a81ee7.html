      <p>Hao and hanbin obviously go on flowershop dates and dinner dates every 2 dates for fanservice.
Hao knows some day a shipper will ask for a tmi and he needs to have hands-on experience to answer otherwise his evil master plan could go down the drain.
And hanbin is obviously threatened to cooperate. Poor baby</p>
