        <p>ok but its so funny how haobinsplanet worded it that way bc it was not like he mentioned hanbin out of nowhere it was op who asked if he talked to hanbin about it bc he mentioned beforehand that he wanted to try raising a puppy at the dorms ofc hes just simply gonna answer the question and hanbin is also in the same dorm as him 😭😭😭 <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/144108644160723991" class="replyLink">/+r/144108644160723991</a></p>
