        <p>honestly did you have an idea about overlining like i keep stay out of this discussion but he&#x27;s the only member i think who loves to experimenting his makeup since debut, he&#x27;s in less makeup phase in debut era and then suddenly he loves glitters and started doing tanghulu lips every single time, idk what makeup he&#x27;s in right now but i miss when he put glitters in everything <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/138797580250470061" class="replyLink">/+r/138797580250470061</a></p>

        <p>over lining and overall fullness are two diff things he has makeup on that&#x27;s obviously making it more dramatic but it isn&#x27;t purely makeup that&#x27;s making me raise an eyebrow. His lips don&#x27;t have bad migration tho so there&#x27;s that</p>

      <p>his lips are always plump like that, it just give the plumper effect because of overlining and he pouts a lot like the teaser, tbh the discussion didn&#x27;t bother me that much but seeing your anons keep talking about the way his lips changed that much made me chuckle, the overlining is so obvious in this picture because you can see his lipstick is out of the lines of his lips <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/haotexts/status/1875902708169023834"></a></blockquote> <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/138859701294289311" class="replyLink">/+r/138859701294289311</a></p>

      <p>I can tell they&#x27;re majorly over lined and puffed but you can compare his lips to last year they&#x27;re a lot smaller it&#x27;s both crazy makeup and filler but like everyone gets filler it&#x27;s not that crazy</p>
