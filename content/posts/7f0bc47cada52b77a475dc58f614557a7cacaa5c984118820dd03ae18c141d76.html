      <p>Hao has many mom/big sister fans in china so it makes sense I guess. It&#x27;s possible they&#x27;re being selective not only with brands but magazines too, like, arena homme china said they wanted to work with hao again and give him a solo cover, I think they said this around march? and since then rosins have dmed them asking for updates and basically ah+ keeps saying they want him but are waiting for the company&#x27;s confirmation? the last time they asked was in september. And at first everyone thought wk1 was being shitty but then madame figaro announced hao&#x27;s cover so now I&#x27;m thinking wk1 or yh might be purposefully ghosting ah+ because they&#x27;re not a high tier magazine in china? they&#x27;re way below l&#x27;officiel and madame figaro.</p>
