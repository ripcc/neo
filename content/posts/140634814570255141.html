        <p>i have a random question pls don&#x27;t make fun of me but you know how idols pre-record for some music shows at like ass-AM but then the actual live show is around evening sooo i&#x27;m confused do idols get glamed up to record the performance at 3am but after they&#x27;re done... do thay stay glamed up waiting around the building until the show for interviews/winners? orrr do they wash up go to the dorms and then go back and get ready again? sorry lol i just don&#x27;t get it those are some long hours</p>

        <p>I wouldn&#x27;t make fun ðŸ˜­ cuz idk either but im assuming old makeup doesn&#x27;t hold well under stage lights it&#x27;s either getting massively touched up (less likely) or completely redone. I wear a good amount of makeup and I&#x27;d never want my 3am face on cameras so I doubt they leave it on</p>
