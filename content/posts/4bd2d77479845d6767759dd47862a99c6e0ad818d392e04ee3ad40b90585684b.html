      <p>Hao is just a fanservice guy in general he knows what kind of fan you are and he&#x27;ll cater to you a lot of his gf stan repos are actually crazy as well they just don&#x27;t get translatedðŸ˜­ He&#x27;s a smart idol I&#x27;ll give him that I don&#x27;t really wanna get into haobin discourse because it just never ends and I feel like zerocola questions got old like last year sorry I stopped paying attention but he&#x27;s always gonna be someone who does whatever you want him to in a situation like fancalls/fansigns where fans are paying for his time</p>
