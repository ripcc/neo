        <p>I just saw that thing about Everglow and Yiren, but I&#x27;m so confused why people think they&#x27;re successful? For the longest time it was more a question of if/when yh would disband them early. They never got more than 60k sales, they canceled multiple stops their last tour, and from what I heard didn&#x27;t sell out for stops with even sizes of like 2k? They&#x27;re not popular domestically and internationally don&#x27;t sell enough to make up for the lack of endorsements The only argument I ever hear about them is that they were &quot;super popular&quot; but the only metrics that could even suggest that are their spotify streams and yt views, which are definitely inflated (especially in their earlier mvs, less so now). I vaguely remember one of their mvs was competing with bts for number of views, which just couldn&#x27;t have happen without excessive ads or view buying at their popularity level. Don&#x27;t know about spotify, but regardless they weren&#x27;t earning enough to overcome the production costs for comebacks to actually get paid. I was never really into them, but I&#x27;ve heard news about their touring and hiatus from reddit, plus I checked on their album sales. This is one of the threads where people are a bit more realistic about their position: https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/14p8b52/everglows_hiatus_doesnt_make_any_sense/ . I thought that groundless optimism about EG&#x27;s success was limited to reddit and twitter, but I&#x27;m surprised that it&#x27;s also here.</p>

        <p>got ur other message but i was just under the impression they were able to make enough profit to make back whatever charges. their momentum was totally destroyed after that hiatus they had some kind of wave at the beginning tho icl they always spiked their mv views but they had good traction for a yh gg at the time but damn i guess not</p>

      <p>long time fan of everglow here and i knew this issue would pop up in here since your anons like to discuss anything lol : yiren is their visual center, was their most popular member and was extremely popular back in produce48. during everglow&#x27;s debut year, they were actually in competition with most if not all 2019 rookies (and you already that was a huge year for kpop) don&#x27;t get me wrong, yuehua is horrible but the issue that ultimately lead to their hiatus was that yiren was chinese, and yuehua was a chinese company. yiren received considerable harassment and unwarranted for the way she bowed for chinese new year and her stances on one china, which then lead yuehua to put her on a hiatus and send her to china for nearly 2 years and dungeon everglow in the process. the reason they tanked was that yuehua realised they couldn&#x27;t make a profit in korea out of them. and the worst thing is that the girls didn&#x27;t do anything, it was just netizens that hated them for coming from a chinese company and being chinese and yuehua made them pay the price for it. thats why ongoing conversations about this make me upset cuz its way deeper than just album sales and whatever. /+r/161000895520396915</p>

      <p>hfjjhgfdjk yesss. i had thought that was the reason for their downfall but i didnt wanna bring up smth that could be wrong. i rmbr how bad the harassment was for the bowing controversy every time the issue gets brought up in a hypothetical manner with zb1 cline i shudder cuz bumbaaaa it was bad. idt anyone means to upset but i guess ppl are trying to find reason in why theyre not getting paid its simple yh just doesnt want to</p>
