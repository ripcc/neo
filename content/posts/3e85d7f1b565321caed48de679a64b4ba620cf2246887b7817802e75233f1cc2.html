      <p>Yoongi needs to resign after the scandal he had, Jhope will probably resign too, Jin is super chill and he doesn&#x27;t seem to care that much about other kpop groups unlike Jungkook who went and defended a bunch of idols, he honestly probably dgaf about the mess that&#x27;s going on right now so he will resign. I feel like the ones who are less likely to resign are RM and Maknae line.</p>
