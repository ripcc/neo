      <p>It was literally about taerae 💀 Gyuvin said “I’m always thinking about zeroses” and Taerae said “what about me are you thinking about me” then Gyuvin said “no the company bans coming out”. literally implying that Taerae was coming on to him in a gay way. Y’all have twisted the narrative like crazy but it was a homophobic joke against Taerae and even Gyuvin’s biggest translation account who speaks korean natively clocked that immediately and called him out</p>

      <p>how did I twist the narrative?? he made a bad joke bouncing off taerae I saw the queer korean fans call him out on it too lol the only real twisting that ever happened were people claiming it was some activist ploy against wakeone.. it came off as a generalizing joke not really targeting taerae who mind you had a good laugh at it it was obviously a casual homophobic joke a teen like him would make at a friend ur implying it was more than that and some kind of target at taerae specifically that&#x27;s just not the case 😭</p>
