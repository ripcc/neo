      <p>Yeah like cmiiw but one of the videos she sent to her own bg was one of tr hb gw airport fits and she was praising them and i think the overall tone of how she spoke of the group as a whole rather than just focusing on her individual 4 show that she‚Äôs aware how successful and profitable they are as a group. I could see her being ok with a contract extension as long as she gets some favourable terms in there</p>
