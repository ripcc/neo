        <p>only hao, hanbin and yujin getting fancams for all the songs performed at gayo while other groups had all members get fancams reminded me of something.. i swore i read before that kpop companies pay/choose who gets official fancams but i searched and nothing came up but STILL i&#x27;m about to sound like one of those zeroses that blame wakeone for everything but i&#x27;m wondering if they&#x27;re part of why this happened since they&#x27;re so against group activities like even when it comes to this &#x27;solo&#x27; stuff not all members can get it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣</p>

        <p>I was checking the page but every member got fancams for gayo in other groups I didn&#x27;t see that 🤔? but oh hell naw.. but yea I&#x27;ve read that somewhere and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that they have some crazy non group agenda they&#x27;re just weird but idk how true the fancam thing is</p>
