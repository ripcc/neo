      <p>Even if taerae IS autistic you can still find parts of his personality annoying 😭🤦‍♀️ god forbid someone doesn’t like someoneeee likeeeeeee. Fellas is it ableist to not like someone based off the way they interact with people or how they act? 🤪 fuck outta here. OG anon saying they don’t like him and a new one calling him autistic as a way to defend any criticism or dislike, booo 👎🍅🍅 I’m autistic and I find several autistic people at school annoying af and don’t like them like shut upppppp. At least this time it isn’t Ricky catching his 500th neurodivergent case 🫥</p>
