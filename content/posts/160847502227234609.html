        <p>Akgaes will probably keep up with hanbin and hao&#x27;s respective redebuts to see if they flop or not, but they&#x27;ll eventually move on. /+r/160535720782683628</p>

      <p>akgaes will never admit it but a lot of them are addicted to the rush of being an akgae more than being actually a fan of their fav. they find comfort in complaining and when their fav is in a environment where they are free they will leave their side. i feel like ricky is most likely to have more of these than anyone else /+r/160542825845576989</p>
