      <p>https://neospring.org/+r/5d0bceb062 oh yeah anon who sent the original ask here i do remember taerae doing that one crush high note where he went way higher that was definitely live my bad ðŸ˜­ i remember he said something about how he was frustrated which is why he did that so maybe the mics have been made way low for all of them? or they feel like they&#x27;re not doing well vocal wise so that&#x27;s why he was frustrated and vocals aren&#x27;t that live? idk</p>
