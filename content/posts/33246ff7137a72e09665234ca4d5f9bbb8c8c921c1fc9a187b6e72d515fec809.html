      <p>are you talking about a****? cause i was looking at that lineup and they stuck out like a sore thumb considering who the rest of the lineup is in that announcement? kinda surprising too cause I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve ever been</p>

      <p>why are u censoring ðŸ˜­?? And yes it&#x27;s obvious they were the replacement if zb1 was there it would&#x27;ve been a complete lineup of popular 5th gen bgs and clearly the award criteria doesn&#x27;t matter cuz only 2/5 are maybe getting awards LOL</p>
