        <p>if true that&#x27;s kinda shocking bc i feel like they&#x27;ll try holding onto him, i mean he&#x27;s their newest potential breadwinner. i get why he&#x27;d wanna leave (and i do kind of want that for him since they&#x27;re not the greatest and idk if they want what he wants yk, though the next bit explains possible bad of it) but then i wonder where he&#x27;d go since idk what company would take him in? on one hand he&#x27;s the most popular member of a popular boy group so you&#x27;d think by that lots of companies would be fighting for him, on the other hand he&#x27;s on the older side and chinese which most companies won&#x27;t like. i&#x27;m sure a nugu company would be fine with taking him in for the clout of it all but would they even be able to handle someone who&#x27;s so popular, would they have the resources for promotion and good music etc etc i&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s no rumours of ricky leaving if anything. he could easily pay his way out and they don&#x27;t seem to rock with him as much as with hao and yujin clearly <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/145688488375966363" class="replyLink">/+r/145688488375966363</a></p>

        <p>honestly I&#x27;m not sure it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s coming from yhs side at all so they could very well still have future plans for him but there&#x27;s literally nothing about rky it&#x27;s crazy. not about leaving not about staying he&#x27;ll probably leave tho he&#x27;s always been last in yhz</p>

      <p>honestly, it makes me wonder if zhg will actually have a better chance of negotiating better terms for himself (like staying in Korea more and doing like a balance btw china and Korea/international activities) because i think yh def has plans for him and will not want to let him go esp. if wyb ever decides to leave. i feel like zhg has a v strong vision for himself and is v individually strong and could do decently well for himself as a soloist. i also understand the sentiments of him in the new yh bg but he kinda just screams being a soloist and he does have a solo fanbase that goes hard for him<a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/145697834119944767" class="replyLink">/+r/145697834119944767</a></p>
