      <p>ok im back now that neospring is up!!!!! and the honda crv is genuinely such a good choice i own an older model personally but i think the newer models aren&#x27;t particularly ugly! and also, what you said about hyundai&#x27;s being like kia soul&#x27;s, thats because hyundai also makes kias so they&#x27;re fairly similar in that regard.
but yea anyways honda makes good cars, i would also rec. the toyota rav4 because it&#x27;s fairly similar and is also reliable! but tbh all newer cars are built worse than they used to be :/ everythings just built bad nowadays so make sure to try your hardest in maintenance so you can make it last a while <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/148664905011257135" class="replyLink">/+r/148664905011257135</a></p>
