        <p>I wasn&#x27;t there for this but from what I&#x27;ve heard they claimed voice fabrication? or smth they did the same audio forensics (idk the results) but this basically got pushed under the rug and they were seemingly fine somehow üò≠ but also this was a completely diff era of kpop shit was crazy back then every bg was getting exposed for some bullshit like this everyday and it&#x27;s totally diff from turning around and disrespecting a fan. and idk if ur implying no hope because zbwon have a lot of ssngs? but this is definitely not happening like I said different era so different rules zbwon are locked down (also different people lol)</p>
