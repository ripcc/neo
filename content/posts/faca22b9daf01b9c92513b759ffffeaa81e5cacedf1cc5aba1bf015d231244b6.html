      <p>I don&#x27;t think tr not hugging gv back (though he did at the end) means anything, he&#x27;s really shy when it comes to receiving skinship so a 3 minute hug kinda has him wondering what he should even do ðŸ˜­ but gv mentioned that tr entrusted him with his problems and stuff so they definitely made up now, they even interacted in yesterday&#x27;s livestream again after completely ignoring each other for like the past 10</p>
