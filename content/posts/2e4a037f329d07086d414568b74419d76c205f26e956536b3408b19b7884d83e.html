      <p>Anon doesn&#x27;t know Chinese market. The brands that Hao are being endorsed had Chinese big stars endorsed before him. Unlike luxury brands, household brands are even more difficult to get. Look at how new jeans bagging luxury brands just months after debut when they aren&#x27;t known globally yet. Luxury brands don&#x27;t get endorsers for sales but new market potential. household brands need someone with recognizable name and face because they need real-time sales. If you&#x27;re a household brand, you don&#x27;t get khia to endorse your brand. Hao is probably a regional BA/BS. Olay had Bailu before.</p>
