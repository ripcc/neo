        <p>i was wondering maybe bc it&#x27;s not an official schedule?? so they&#x27;re being told not to engage to the reporters that much <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138469652606179417">/138469652606179417</a></p>

      <p>I doubt it, when they filmed camp zb1 and they flew to jeju they were interacting loads with the reporters <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138473094657563715">/138473094657563715</a></p>

      <p>right this is left field to how they usually are this is some RIIZE behavior but another anon said they&#x27;re probably exhausted from training all night which makes sense</p>
