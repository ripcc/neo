      <p>The pann comments seem positive though? I mean it&#x27;s kinda backhanded saying how he looks better without heavy makeup (I agree) but it&#x27;s still in a positive except for the few who clearly don&#x27;t know how eyelid tape works and how one goes to get plastic surgery to get double eyelids not monolids 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ his aren&#x27;t even monolids though I think they&#x27;re hooded double eyelids also this just proves at least to me he really didn&#x27;t get any plastic surgery at all because eyelid surgery is so normalized like a youth passage yet he never got it done and rather go through the hassle with eyelid tape. /+r/143062122337884266</p>
