        <p>might be controversial but mattbin have very little chemistry as a duo, and even lesser as performers. theyâ€™re obviously good friends but their styles do not match each other at all and iâ€™m not sure why they get paired up a lot, or why people even want to see it. itâ€™s quite painful to watch because i think theyâ€™re both good dancers but very very different. hanbin is a lot more technical while matthew is groovier. they just both make the other look bad and end up looking bad themselves together, sorry. matthewâ€™s best pairing for dance would be gunwook. hanbin probably yujin. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/131682758560013827" class="replyLink">/+r/131682758560013827</a></p>

      <p>hard agree with anon and i think its because those two are just really great friends. i see their chemistry as an older brother and younger brother one. its more fun to watch on zepisodes instead of tiktoks. they should post more funny tiktoks (favorably with my boy ðŸ™„) instead of ones that are dance focused. they should post dance covers etc only over on youtube. their tiktok page looks like a mess <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/131743678262892515" class="replyLink">/+r/131743678262892515</a></p>
