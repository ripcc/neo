      <p>i meannnnnnnnnn you have to remember he initially debuted in 3rd gen and went through a bunch of traumatising shit ðŸ˜­ it&#x27;s probably the difference between him and then these younger, 5th gen guys who were coming into the industry pretty much unscathed. i feel like if you grouped him with the 98 liners from 3rd gen (vernon/seungkwan from svt, sinb/umji from gfriend, dahyun from twice etc) he probably seems more &#x27;normal&#x27; than him being with zb1 /+r/151426525634452120</p>
