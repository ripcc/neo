        <p>Ohhh this!! I got a few things to add about the Twitter chick zb1leader. She is so weird, I got moots telling me she gets into fansigns, mcd recording, any pre recording etc via illegal ways. She used to &quot;host&quot; group orders on Twitter for joiners to buy so she can use the sales to get into fansigns etc. Apparently a couple of her joiners never got their stuff and she would claim on Twitter how she&#x27;s on hiatus. Meanwhile on her TikTok and other sns accounts, you see her attending a bunch of zb1 concerts from south kroea to Japan to other Asia countries. She&#x27;s also friends with the other Twitter account mycathao who recently complained about how foreigners not getting into the showcase. Either way that zb1leader is a weirdo. She&#x27;s always saying how hanbin recognizes her and how other members also know she&#x27;s hanbins fan. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/147009090000999136" class="replyLink">/+r/147009090000999136</a></p>
