      <p>hao literally posts every day and talks about what he does regularly he just doesnt overshare or tweak like gyuvin and hanbin does in a day so the messages seem lesser but he is as active as those two ðŸ˜­ what i just dont get is he is active in every single social media but they never post him on twt even for some of his brand zerofocus mdjrurjrjr /+r/2db328a0da</p>

      <p>twitters their most erratic platform and the app constantly changing doesn&#x27;t help it&#x27;s barely a useful thing to post on anymore it&#x27;s just customary for kpop I guess maybe they choose to do weibo of zerofocuses? Idk but from a marketing standpoint twitter is the worst platform to use</p>
