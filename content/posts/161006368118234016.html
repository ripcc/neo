        <p>side tracked a lil but are prerec tributes deducted from their paycheck as well? when kickflip debut they had snack food truck for music show prerec and a fan made a post saying they don’t have to do it cuz they just debut and likely are not making any money yet which reminds me of when yujin said he bought 10 scarfs for doctor doctor emka prerec. i was under the impression the company paid for it all <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160540095764715823">/160540095764715823</a></p>

      <p>I feel like if they were a regular nugu group they trained and debuted they might but it doesn’t make any sense with zb1 because their making wayyyy to much profit of those boys to be taking fan tributes out of their pay check <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160843390106426473">/160843390106426473</a></p>
