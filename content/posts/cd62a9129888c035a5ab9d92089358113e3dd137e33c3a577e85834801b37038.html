      <p>The live was necessary for the Korean public to pour their support on the girls. Hanni is so instrumental in all of these. I&#x27;m glad that the haters focused on Hanni because if not for what she said, none of these hybe shits will come out. They can&#x27;t even drag Hanni because they will come out as Xenophobic. I think, everything happens for a reason and favors NJ&#x27;s side the most. Hybe is meant to be exposed &amp; go down. They did so much damage to Kpop that I don&#x27;t recognize it anymore.</p>
