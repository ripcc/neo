      <p>okay yea you can tell theyre not rocking butttt the fact that it happened is something its probably awkward even tho gunrae are kinda tight watching them hold hands was still awkward asf i think theyre fine w each other it was probably just awk since gyuvins so touchy feely and people could tell they werent getting along 😭 idt theyre gonna be buddy buddy but it seems like to me at least theyre not gonna flat out ignore each other anymore</p>
