      <p>of course technically it would be hanbin bc he trained for it for years but majority especially the untrained eyes are saying mattwook does it better even for me who danced for years still leans more on watching mattwook bc they express the song better but when learning the choreo i like watching hanbin since he&#x27;s learner its more like a dance teacher thing more than a performer /+r/aa888d7a45</p>

      <p>yeaaaa I&#x27;ve watched some of the dance behinds he&#x27;s sharp so he&#x27;s a good teacher but yea I find mattwook more interesting their performance values up there so mixed with their ability I can see why people always lean to them I do too</p>
