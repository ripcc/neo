        <p>redacting would probably cause discourse it makes ppl too curious ðŸ˜­ and no idk nobody would know unless his contract got leaked. We&#x27;ve already talked about this we can assume the length was set for longer than zbwon probably 7 years in some cases but everyone&#x27;s terms and fees is different. so those with less parent company prospects can easily transfer if they get picked up</p>
