      <p>I think their growth have been pretty slow compared to how hard they were pushed specifically this year they&#x27;ve always been a duo liked by fav and they&#x27;re also yh favs and well liked by w1, since the beginning of the group they&#x27;re usually in the same group in content or pics and even had a duo magazine, crosins have always been annoyed by this because they believed yh/w1 were pushing Yujin to be the center but as a whole everyone was chill with it because it wasn&#x27;t too much, now as well known about two or three months after the cosmopolitan shoot a big yhz dinner happened and there&#x27;s been a noticeable shift in how luckyz were presented to the public specifically on yujins part like the change was immediate and obvious with Yujin talking z lot more about Hao and even commenting on his live etc and iniating a lot more interactions + as always being paired in content+ push on socmed that fans have criticised, now if you were on wb like the past few months you know this has caused an intense anger against Yujin from crosins because they basically call him a leech and that his actions are fake etc they&#x27;ve grown annoyed at how hard yh rides for them and are worried about if this is all just using Hao to prop up Yujin, this has led to a lot of threats and private discussions surrounding hurting Yujin image specifically in kr as we all know that his dating life and his friendship/preference towards his rich fans isn&#x27;t a secret, I honestly expected it to happen but you can see, despite the push irl their impact isn&#x27;t really felt much not even in Macau gyubrik and especially haobin fans outnumber them by a lot, I think this has calmed down some crosins about luckyz since they do hate haobin more than anything and are willing to push other pairs if it can hurt haobins popularity (luckyz, soobhao-the two times Hao has been asked about soobin is after big haobin moments that engaged rosins-the confirmation of the pfp rumour and haos actions afterwards and the w event lap sitting), now interestingly, w1 seem to slowly start</p>

      <p>yea agree things really shifted after that dinner and the threads about yujin from cfans pop up on twitter every few months ðŸ˜­during riizes 3/11 smth kinda big came out about him and it went unnoticed cuz everyone even i wasnt paying attention i didnt see anything except the aftermath but probably more digging on him and smth about his friends i gotta look for the picture but i doubt the duo wouldve been taken as well over in china but dangggggg not its gonna pick up</p>
