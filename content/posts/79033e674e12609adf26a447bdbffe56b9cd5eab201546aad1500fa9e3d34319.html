      <p>I donâ€™t think that is that incriminating lmao he literally has a video of his putting his arm around a girl during dance practice it isnâ€™t insane to think teens have friends of other genders, especially in the west</p>

      <p>I don&#x27;t think he took the photo down because a girl or a prom pic his identity is attached to the page since it has his face it&#x27;s probably safer to just take it down not to mention he&#x27;s pretty easy to find on hella platforms ðŸ˜­ maybe he was getting friend requests but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;d even be using duolingo unless he&#x27;s trynna pick up a whole new language like outside of Japanese and Chinese</p>
