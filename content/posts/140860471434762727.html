        <p>Is it the result of center oriented survival show that makes them think center = gets everything??honestly I like how group now have a fair line distribution, though not all groups and all songs but older groups have the worst line distribution to the point that one member only get to sing &quot;ohh~&quot; that&#x27;s it, and honestly to me all of zb1 members can sing so it&#x27;s not weird that they distributed the line fairly (not everyone in the same level but at least they can do their own part well)

        <p>this is my first survival show so im not too sure about everything else but p1 and p2 fans fighting has always been destiny i think the obsession with centerism is new with bopl/zbwon tho. the solo song plus zh being a foreigner made everything worse i think they also specified with bopl that 1st place is the center while its not exactly named in other shows and groups</p>

      <p>i think its cause hao is chinese. people are trying to turn kpop into cpop and that will never work or happen doesnt matter how popular first place is. in chinese groups the center gets almost everything while the others watch, thats what these people want but if that was the case nobody would send their trainees to survival shows ðŸ˜‚ koreans are not that desperate for a platform for their trainees if it doesnt even benefit them. in china its different cause you dont have this korean system of idols where they can perform and shine <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140613151023651391">/140613151023651391</a></p>
