People said sunwoo and hyunjae sfs are the worst of all. I remember when sunwoo&#x27;s sf attacked a fangirl just because he replied to her weverse account and what trigger them more is when the other fans praising her for her looks and that she looks like sawako (sunwoo and his sawakok obsession) and many more stories about their jealousy
