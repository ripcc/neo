      <p>Now that anon pointed it out Iâ€™m noticing it so much especially rn that loads of the rosin akgaes are going on a tweak spree telling all my Chinese moots who are correcting the mistranslation to off themselves ect ðŸ˜­ the worst part is none of these moots are defending the person just correcting the translation and then these rosins who wanna act like they care about Chinese people come in to talk over Chinese people tell them to off themselves, throw abuse at them and do it all under digital blackface because they think it gives them the means to scary persona online by playing into harmful stereotypes. These performative hoes.</p>
