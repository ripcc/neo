        <p>I was hoping for zb1 on daechinseo since gd is also going to mca next week and we really need the extra broadcast points if we want any chance of winning esp since they don’t seem to be going on any cj shows this era. But I have a feeling they won’t have any guest since it’s sh last week, I was wondering if anyone knows would we still get broadcast points cuz technically hb is there</p>
