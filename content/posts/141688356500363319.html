        <p>hb does nawt have jowls ðŸ˜­ you might be thinking that bc his chin can make his cheeks look different depending on the faces he makes. on the other hand just the other day I was trying to see if Hao does have some bc when he&#x27;s resting the sides of his mouth drop and make some little bumps but idk <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/140941064025627235" class="replyLink">/+r/140941064025627235</a></p>

        <p>hbn must have really good elasticity even with his weight yoyoing there hasn&#x27;t been any droop and yea I&#x27;ve noticed that too w zhg but I think that&#x27;s just because of how his face is shaped. some people have divets under their mouths that cause the top to protrude and resemble jowls it&#x27;s common in people with overbites which he had the fillers and implant def aren&#x27;t helping</p>
