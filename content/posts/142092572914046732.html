      <p>Lowkey he was doing a bit of both, maybe not so much near crush time but deffo pre debut - 1st fancom time because whenever they’d be in stage your always see him giving stage directions ect to members and they never had a performance director in sight. I wouldn’t say he had the full responsibilities of their performance director but it’s really clear wakeone was under prepared in many aspects to take on zb1 and really just used his back group to try and quickly fill a gap he shouldn’t have had to fill tbh /+r/142087040635460241</p>
