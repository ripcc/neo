      <p>im kinda new here, i always thought zb1 were close friends or at least they actually enjoyed spending time with eachother but ever since i&#x27;ve been lurking here i&#x27;ve been questioning it a lot, do they even enjoy being on the group bc of each other type of questioning. from what you know and what you&#x27;ve heard how close do you think they actually are (as a group of 9)? from like a scale from 1 to 10</p>
