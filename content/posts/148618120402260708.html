You&#x27;re a piece of shit and I just know you&#x27;re a koreaboo allin who thinks your fav deserves things just because he&#x27;s korean. Plenty of foreigner idols like yuqi and jackson were promoted and the people who are being promoted on variety shows aren&#x27;t all that either. This is actually grossing me out. It&#x27;s crazy how you guys can twist zh not having a korean schedule for half a year into this. And fyi gp dgaf about any members of zb1 like you&#x27;re implying and zhang hao has one of the most kfans???? You really think people are tuning in for gyuvin? and yet he&#x27;s there isn&#x27;t he. Fyi nobody was mad he has a schedule. You guys just perpetuate really gross xenophobia when you talk about him. You&#x27;re literally proving my fucking point fuck you. </p>
