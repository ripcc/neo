      <p>Ive felt this since the beginning of the year but something shifted in 2024 so many people are falling and SM have been falling apart internally for a while too, it may seem like they&#x27;re winning from the outside but I&#x27;m willing to bet they&#x27;ll fall soon at least in the next year and a half, with jyp and yg already on the floor this will mark the death of kpop as we know it (which is actually really good for the industry)</p>

      <p>EFFING SAY THATTTTT KPOP IS FLOPPINGGGGGG which ive been needing its been so ass since the attempted big company monopolies and the beg for western fame lets start being ourselves and bring back middle-small size successes its surprising sm hasnt totally failed yet but they really know how to resonate with the kpublic. the total standard for kpops shifted i wonder if were gonna see a focus away from groups or a new shift</p>
