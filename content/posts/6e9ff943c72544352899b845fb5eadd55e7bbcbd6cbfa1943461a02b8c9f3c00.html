      <p>They&#x27;re definitely still a part of the industry a lot of acts just got famous off of their music (namely bp and no one really saw them as real musicians) they have their own bbl/pc type platforms and are very active in the industry imo they&#x27;re just slightly more musically and artistically inclined than the average kpop group depending on how the rest of their career go Id put them in red velvet/wonder girls territory, I do agree tho that they deserve respect as people for actually going against a conglomerate and facing so much vitriol and mysogyny bravely esp at a young age, they&#x27;re the bravest idols I&#x27;ve ever seen since tvxq</p>
