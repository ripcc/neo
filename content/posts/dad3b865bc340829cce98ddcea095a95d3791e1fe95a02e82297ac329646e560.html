      <p>was curious about when the singapore concert started bc the soundcheck felt so early so i was wondering if there was a huge gap in between, or maybe it was just the timezone etc but apparently the concert starts at 4pm bruh i wish i had early concerts i hate having to find a way home late at night they&#x27;re lucky as hell</p>
