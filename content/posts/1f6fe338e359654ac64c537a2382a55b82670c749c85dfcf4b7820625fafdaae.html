      <p>The problem with lsf is that they have no sense of authenticity whatsoever, the hybe execs are chasing trends each comeback like reggaeton, afrobeats, and house and giving it to them to put it on like a costume in an effort to appeal to the western audience without any real appreciation or creativity to them, I just watched the mtv performance and it&#x27;s just appropriation through and through which kpop artists can get away with if they give it a cute twist but there&#x27;s nothing and the repeated parts on the song sound awfully generic because they can&#x27;t sing</p>
