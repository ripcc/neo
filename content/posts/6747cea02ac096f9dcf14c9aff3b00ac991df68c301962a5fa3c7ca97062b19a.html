      <p>the main reason ppl think wk1 hates yhz is because ricky had zero solo jobs before his endorsements + the drama with his passport + lack of presence on twt, ig and tiktok compared to other members. in hao&#x27;s case I think ppl were mad at the way wk1 ignored l&#x27;officiel for weeks only to contact them to ask them to take down their post about hao&#x27;s cover + they allegedly told hao that the blue dragon awards weren&#x27;t important(?) and didn&#x27;t let him accept his award in person. rosins were also screaming mistreatment when he only got 1 job during good so bad. gyuvinists and muls have been complaining since last year and it&#x27;s only gotten better for them recently with yujin&#x27;s mc gig and gyuvin&#x27;s other gigs. iirc they didn&#x27;t have many schedules last year which was so weird to me considering they were really popular during bp.
but if I&#x27;m being honest, I don&#x27;t think wk1 hates them ðŸ˜­ it&#x27;s just that whoever manages them is incompetent asf. I do think ricky&#x27;s lack of socmed presence in their official accounts is weird tho because sometimes the staff will post pictures of every single member but him ðŸ˜­
but going back to the &quot;wk1 hates yhz&quot; conspiracy, yhz themselves encourage that mentality with the exception of yujin ðŸ˜­ hao flames and &quot;exposes&quot; wk1 every day, ricky said the company knew he was unhappy and that he wants to be more active on ig and +chat but can&#x27;t, and gyuvin told a fan who wanted to audition for wk1 to run away and to audition for yuehua instead ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like, what are their fans supposed to think when their favs say stuff like that?</p>

      <p>oh i know why people say this but its more the fact that running to make narratives is just inevitable we talked ab it last week how kpop fans cant be normal about the company their artist is under even if there are valid critiques. like i couldve told you the dayyyyy zb1 were formed exactly how things were gonna turn out people alreayd expected mistreatment for hao and ricky because theyre chinese and the nature of the industry so a couple wrong moves would cement their fate in the eyes of fans and ig cuz theyre 2/4 of yhz the narrative reached over everyone. for ricky its the most valid i guess.. even tho its annoying and still majorly illogical because of his lack of schedules but listing what he said on that fancall is bogus to me CUZ HE DONT OPEN HIS PHONENJFEN thats all him sis. for hao i think its more handling issues but hes not close to poverty in the slightest there can be conversation about how the cpromo efforts arent useful to him since hes a survival show idol but im not chatting to nobody who gets crazy and stupid ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘‹ and dont even get me started on yujin and gyuvin their fans are the most annoying because theyre treated the best for whats its worth AND GYUVIN GOES ON WEEKLY COKE RANTS HIS WORDS DONT MEAN NUN HALF THE TIME!!!!! yujin fans are greedy bastards and gyuvin fans cant be shocked that he was shelved because of his string of microscandals but those 2 have it good wow this just got me irked cuz these people shouldnt have the nerve but they do ugh but ur right if u not a free thinker what else are u supposed to do its whatever cuz i dont care to mingle or talk amongst fans like that</p>
