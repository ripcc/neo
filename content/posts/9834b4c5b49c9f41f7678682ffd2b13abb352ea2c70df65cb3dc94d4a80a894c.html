      <p>It took me a whole 24 hours to listen to rose full album.. idk hers kinda mid, it&#x27;s about the same story all over again (cannot move on with ex, red flag, begging ex to stay &amp; the cycle continues). At least I can differentiate songs in olivia rodrigo album even though she wrote about her ex too but it&#x27;s a bit hard to do that with rose&#x27;s songs</p>
