      <p>Right like the others can get lit enough every group needs at least 1 boring member ðŸ˜­ plus if anyoneâ€™s watched the Osaka vlog when they actually hang out outside the work environment heâ€™s exactly the same as all of them which makes the vibes of content like that enjoyable too <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/145700668446037057" class="replyLink">/+r/145700668446037057</a></p>
