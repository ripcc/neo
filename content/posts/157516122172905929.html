        <p>i was trying to think back to last year&#x27;s and then realised wow did they not have a fancon (not the japan one but a korea one) in 2024??? the trauma from the 2023 one omg i know wakeone were sick ðŸ’€ but i hope they improve from the 2023 fancon, keep the games from the japan one bc those were fun and add covers/dance challenges c&#x27;mon!!!!!!!!!!! /+r/157353815291679647</p>

        <p>no like there hasnt been a fancon since 2023 FHJGJHEJ U JUST KNOW KFANS WERE FUMINGGGGG esp with how amazing the japan fancon was down to the poster omg they actually used to call zbwon traitors everyday it was so scary ðŸ˜­ but i think they learned their lesson that was their first L in their entire career and they lost so many casuals lmao. the hints from the fansign sound like special stages for the fancon so theres hope</p>
