      <p>hmmmm I wouldn&#x27;t peg her as that totally since she doesn&#x27;t decorate herself as a rsin and started this obsession from being an alln. like she doesn&#x27;t like zgh at all I think she likes being in the proximity of an idol she likes the group of and probably gets off on knowing she loathes him but he&#x27;ll give her fanservice cuz he doesn&#x27;t know ðŸ˜­</p>
