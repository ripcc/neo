      <p>I&#x27;ll check but the fansigns always differ I&#x27;m pretty sure one of the cline members wore a hanbok and or their own traditional clothes at a fansign half the time staff will take their gifts completely cross out their answers like that doesn&#x27;t rlly matter he&#x27;ll probably get the chance at some other fansign</p>
