        <p>He better be saving up like crazy then because ik sometimes it’s not a set amount to buy out a contract and rather what they value you as a ‘product’ as. So let’s say they estimated to make X amount of money through him debuting with them , they may ask for a similar amount to cover their estimated loss and release him from contract <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/145700048058146503" class="replyLink">/+r/145700048058146503</a></p>
