      <p>it still makes sense because they want yujin to be more popular. if a ship gets popular both sides benefit from it. they could try and push yj with somebody else but as we all know popular members getting shipped together makes the ship in itself automatically more popular <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/145691593083671214" class="replyLink">/+r/145691593083671214</a></p>
