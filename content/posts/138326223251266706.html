      <p>After looking into it my understanding is the organisers wanted to work with him reached out and wakeone confirmed the job for him in November time. Discussions took place with his fanbases about fan preferences (for what I’m not sure) but since the original accepting of the offer mid November wakeone has not been responding to the organise at all so the job hasn’t been able to progress/ happen. The organiser then reached out to his cbar saying they are still interested in working with him it’s just wakeone isn’t responding. They then talked to the other fanbases as well because I mean nearly 2 months is a crazy time to leave a job hanging especially if you agreed to it and then never do it because preparations and planning would have been made around that job happening and the possibility of it falling through because wakeone can’t respond to emails is a terrible look. /+r/138202003552819333</p>
