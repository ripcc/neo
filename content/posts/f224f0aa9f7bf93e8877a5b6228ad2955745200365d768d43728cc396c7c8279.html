      <p>I miss 2023 because all though we were fighting in the trenches, the members themselves were doing insane or stupid shit, and lord remembers Gyuvinâ€™s spam replies, it was so much fun. Like you could feel the excitement in the air, they were the undisputed top rookie boy group, everyone was tuning in. It was the highest of highs and some of the lowest of lows. But now, in late 2024, so much momentum has been lost. My favorite reactors who used to watch ZB1 content constantly barely ever reacts to them now. They changed their ults. And although I know one personâ€™s change doesnâ€™t mean doom, itâ€™s making me really sad because I remember when they were obsessed with them. 2023 ZB1 were so unique, unfiltered, and felt more like real people without the media training than the typical idol. And I miss that phase of their career almost every day. What I would do to relive that excitement and the feeling I felt when they won at MAMA awards and got their rookie grand slam. Everything feels so convoluted now. Obviously more cautious (more experience, more filtering, etc. etc.) and more tamed. Itâ€™s natural in a way but still, it makes me so sad.</p>

      <p>i miss it everyday they felt so fresh and immature it was sooooo charming like their first few times with mobs was so funny you could tell how geeked they were ðŸ˜­ like truly it was the best experience stanning them last year but i dont really think of it as something to be sad about maturing as artists is inevitable and something we would want in the long run anyways. Being a group thats often bullied, management issues, jiwoongs scandal also making them more cautious there was noooo way theyd stay the same but youre right its natural and you can still see them be stupid its just not as often or heightened not to mention their content stream and promo is at an all time shit level rn ugh. I reminisce that era of them a lot but i just know i wouldnt be half as lit stanning another group</p>
