        <p>kzeroses mad af about the high range of their songs like it still blows my mind away they keep giving them these super high songs (that most of them pull off decently but still) when literally everyone wants to hear them in some lower ranges where they sound better and more comfortable like genuinely curious who&#x27;s behind this</p>
