      <p>Idk about luckyz but soobin and hao (before people found out they were actually friends) was being pushed almost as a crackship by a specific group of troll hao fans who aren&#x27;t very connected to or have a good relationship with the larger rosin fanbase, they were the ones that first asked about soobin in a fansign and they&#x27;re actually more accepting of haobin than the average rosin since they just like to troll around so this was definitely not rosin damage control pushing or however anon phrased itðŸ˜­ The real akgae rosins who hate hanbin have a different air to them they like doing stuff like telling hao how much he&#x27;s sold from an endorsement to emphasize rosin loyalty or smthing weird like that, they wouldn&#x27;t spend money to ask about soobin</p>
