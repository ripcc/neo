        <p>Let me be brief... i loveeeeee their relationship so much im close to throwing up sometimes. Idc if I sound crazy I think they&#x27;re friends thatve crossed the line with each other I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re tgthr because they&#x27;re not obviously (will they ever be tgthr üòÇü§î also probably no) but.. they&#x27;re smth more trust me they just don&#x27;t know it. The sheer obsession gwk has w mtt is undeniable and it&#x27;s rlly smth deeper than just reg friendship it&#x27;s funny to see how it actually pisses his gf fans off üò≠üò≠ I have a bunch of friends who have a real hatred for the duo and the amt of crash outs they have cuz it&#x27;s unavoidable and very driven is so funny to me they be cussing gwk out lmaoooo. and yes even tho mtt has clout agendas and gets on my nerves he too has an equal obsession it just presents differently. When they talk about living with/next to each other when they&#x27;re older I really believe them they&#x27;re each others special person and their bond transcends the group UGH YOU GOT ME TOO LIT THEY JUST NEED TO OPEN THEIR HEARTS AND DISCOVER THE TRUTH THAT I KNOW THAT THEY DONT AND MAKE PILGRIMAGE TO CANADAWEDDINGHALL</p>
