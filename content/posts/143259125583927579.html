        <p>I went through some haobinist neos to find tea abt the other members but i ended up reading the haobin gossip and why aren&#x27;t they treated like jiwoong when the gp found out abt his gf? They have a crazy amount of rumors and i read that all the staff that&#x27;s worked with jebis since the debut goes around saying that they must be dating. So i was just wondering why the kfans don&#x27;t hate them...</p>

      <p>the situations are totally different tho like jw living outside the dorm with his gf actually affected the group dynamic, that plus haobin basically have plausible deniability unless something concrete leaks bc a lot of kfans probably donâ€™t believe they could be gay and the ones that do are fujoshis lmao /+r/142797210365678625</p>
