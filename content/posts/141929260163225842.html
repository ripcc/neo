        <p>I don&#x27;t get why our voting team is discouraging voting for mcountdown. Like it looks bad that we&#x27;re losing in fanvotes to bnd and we should also be practicing for the comeback</p>

      <p>no. The early prediction you saw was the one created by zb1 voting team which only focused on zb1. In the real early prediction, we&#x27;re like last and even if we somersault, we won&#x27;t win because Ive has 5000 digital points ðŸ˜‚ <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/141688966083728740" class="replyLink">/+r/141688966083728740</a></p>
