        <p>everybody crying about that gyuvin translator deleting her account need to bffr. thousands of ppl were jumping her for comments made on a private account, as if harassing some random on twitter is better than hating on idols in private. an account that might not even be hers mind you!! so what did y‚Äôall expect. and now the rest of us have to suffer because hundreds of translations are just gone forever. literally lost media unless someone goes back and translates those million different lives</p>
