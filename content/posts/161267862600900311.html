      <p>https://x.com/duckpuppytext/status/1902677037464072349 why did this piss me off so bad omg like maybe he&#x27;s being jokey but it doesn&#x27;t come out that way because of how we&#x27;ve been complaining about a lack of group content since forever and how they feel like soloists like LITERALLY ANY OTHER GROUP WOULD POST A BUNCH OF CASUAL PICS TOGETHER OR OF THE OTHER IN A BIRTHDAY POST but of course that doesn&#x27;t happen here, why would zb1 ever do that even though now&#x27;s the time since we&#x27;re not getting content post-disband ðŸ˜’</p>
