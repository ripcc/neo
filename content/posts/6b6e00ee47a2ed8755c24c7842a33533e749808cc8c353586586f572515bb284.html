      <p>I came to know ZB1 by these shipping videos lol, but whenever I watched these so-called Minamz videos, I felt like Ricky was annoyed, but these stupid shippers called it jealousy, and what the hell with this Jiwoong? He is so cringe. Whenever he speaks, I skip his part; I just can&#x27;t watch it. I know you don&#x27;t like talking about him, but I want to just clear one thing here: in these videos, I feel like he just doesn&#x27;t want Matthew to be near him, and after reading that heÂ  is using members, especially Matthew, as Yaoibating, it could be the reason. Please clear this I don&#x27;t want to stan a wrong person.Please clear this up; I don&#x27;t want to stan a wrong person andÂ  proposal thing that he pulled in Macau what was that? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Ricky is sooo fucking uncomfortable with thatÂ  recently and at airport just 2 sec heart</p>
