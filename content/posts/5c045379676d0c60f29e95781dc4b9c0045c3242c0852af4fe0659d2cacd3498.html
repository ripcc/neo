      <p>i think anon missed the whole point 😭😭 the first line was literally “even when they acted tame and lowkey” the times in which you believed there was a whole ban thing the shippers were STILL asking them crazy things so even if they dont do things those people are still gonna exist its a direct response to what anon said that they think haobinist get even more crazier cause of the crazy repos when they were like this even without haobin feeding too much into the ship im literally defending the both of them and blaming all the crazy work solely to haobinist is that wrong i like the idols not the fans 💀</p>
