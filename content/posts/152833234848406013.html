      <p>blue would&#x27;ve been perfect if the choreo wasn&#x27;t iffy, if the mixing was better and if they gave jw&#x27;s chorus to taerae instead. i also don&#x27;t hink it&#x27;s kenzie&#x27;s doing because hearts2hearts debut had kenzie and no2zcat working on it and they didn&#x27;t have any issue with vocal mixing or processing</p>
