        <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/gomgominno/status/1876876134979084527?s=46"></a></blockquote> Ok Ik this account has gotten called out for other reasons but a haobinist tweaking on priv that another duo went to a duo exhibition isnâ€™t exactly shocking information ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like this fork found in kitchen ass tweet. Also unless priv tweets are genuinely something harmful or outright psychotic I never understand why people share priv tweets they could just ignore.  Like there are many shippers of many diffrent duos who probably act exactly the same on their priv accounts.</p>
