      <p>There&#x27;s a trending post on pann about yujin&#x27;s face changing a lot from pre-debut till now and oh wow i didn&#x27;t realize how crazy the difference is until i saw the comparison side by side like i know he did something to his eyes but the way his face shrinked in size i can&#x27;t even pinpoint what he did exactly.. like he looks so different omg ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>we talked about this before on cc I think and lowkey he just went through puberty so much of his face changed that&#x27;s impossible through surgery/impossible to do as a promoting idol the space on his face changed and so did his overall features. I rmbr someone compared his side profiles and you could see his jaw literally grew</p>
