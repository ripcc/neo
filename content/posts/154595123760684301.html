        <p>Iâ€™m suprised how many fans ate it and I agree with anon the smell is the biggest killer. I tried a whole mouthful once and I gagged so bad it genuinely felt like I had eaten something rotten ðŸ˜­ <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/154580733988658954" class="replyLink">/+r/154580733988658954</a></p>

        <p>I&#x27;ve had anons tell me about it being custardy but I&#x27;ve just heard the smell being so overpowering it&#x27;s not worth it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like I don&#x27;t think it would be enjoyable if they smell lingers in ur mouth too</p>
