        <p>Why do people celebrate the sales when the result for each comeback is stagnant... There is no growth at all, reflecting they can&#x27;t attract new fans that much. Even the poca market in korea is not massive anymore. The fandom hates it when haters called them out about caring about ships more than talent, but they do promote ships first when someone is interested in the group. What I hate the most is this fandom vibes totally match SM 2nd gen bgs fandom, a bunch of lazy ass thinking the mistreated ones are getting more and the loved ones are getting mistreatment, the highest worshipper of ships and visuals not talent nor music</p>

      <p>There&#x27;s definitely zerose who care about ships more than talent but there&#x27;s loads of zerose who care more about trying to show their talent discography to other ppl but the matter of fact it&#x27;s Everyone else that cares more about shipping than talent that&#x27;s what they tune into please people on twt only care about talent for bragging points on twt only having talent never translates to anything otherwise nmixx would be the most famous kpop group rn And zb1 have gained lots of new fans on the into side I&#x27;m surprised by how often I see a zerose that joined in 2024 like how did u get here and we already accepted our fate in the kr side ‚úåüèº /+r/153346133429804844</p>
