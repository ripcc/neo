      <p>well apparently he is like that with others too there is another fan saying he acts that way with her too in fansigns in the comments I think
matty is actually insane because I happened to see a fancall on xhs where the camera did not work for the first few seconds and the fan said hi and he recognized her by her voice and started calling her name and how he missed her /+r/160111072819500051</p>
