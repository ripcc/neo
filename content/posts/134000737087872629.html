      <p>ppl keep saying zb1 lost all hype like maybe they did especially in domestic market and gp reach in korea probably lot of casuals left but the core fandom i feel like it has only grown they used to have so many casuals before they&#x27;ve grown in fandom sizes very unexpected but feel the pop and gsb in this time period they&#x27;ve gained a lot i say it as a baby zerose most of my moots are new too, more joined during ftp, idk anything about 2023 cs I wasn&#x27;t there but like my fandom experience had been nice if i ignore the akgaes obviously, its better than any fandom ive been a part of, the general attitude of stantwt toward zb1 is ass but its a lot better than other groups, the hate train on them usually don&#x27;t gain anything, except for ricky bcs i was there when everyone was shitting on him oh my pooks ðŸ’”ðŸ˜­, idek where im going with all this but ig they HAVE grown and reached new audience a bigger one and new fans</p>
