        <p>I doubt it, when they filmed camp zb1 and they flew to jeju they were interacting loads with the reporters <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138473094657563715" class="replyLink">/+r/138473094657563715</a></p>

      <p>pretty sure they have late night practice prior to a flight before too and they still show up smiley. everyone is masked up today just like the day they flew to japan for gda so they might want to show respect to the victims of jeju air incident which happened not even a month ago <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138476364625043438" class="replyLink">/+r/138476364625043438</a></p>
