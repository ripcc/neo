      <p>Wonyoung is still widely known but yujin has more of a girl next door vibe, has actress visuals and has a more universal appeal where all age groups adore her that’s why she’s getting more attention lately, while wonyoung has idol like charms and visuals which is more niche and why her fans are more high school girls and younger women but she doesn’t have that universal charm yujin does</p>
