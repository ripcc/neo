        <p>game nerd here but elon boasting about being top player on path of exile 2 only for him to expose himself that he clearly paid someone in asia to boost his account (level up for him) was funny afffff like his ego is so fucking big and wants validation so fucking much that he did a fucking ego boosting live on x to show off being one of the &#x27;top player&#x27; in the world only for it to turn on him and exposed himself of being a fraudğŸ˜­ he knew none of the terminology and called some of the best and rarest items &#x27;only&#x27; level 62 and literally playing like a grandpa using a laptop for the first time ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ watching some of my favorite streamers laughing at him was so fucking funnyyy sorry i had to share</p>
