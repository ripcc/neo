      <p>Yeah I don’t think the brand is going to say no if fans are saying hey if you delay by a couple weeks we can give you a lot more money. Although I thought they weren’t stressing over sales anymore</p>

      <p>right but i think if they can have the choice to at least move dates around they can try to get good sales cuz this is the biggest endorsement after all</p>
