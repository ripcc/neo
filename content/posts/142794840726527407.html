        <p>there&#x27;s no chance of jiwoong redebuting with any members, right? bc i had this thought earlier today with all this talk about gunwook redebuting under the l1ve and gunwook and jiwoong supposedly getting closer these days.. what if he redebuts with them ðŸ˜­ like i know it&#x27;s probably highly unlikely since he doesn&#x27;t fuck with the members like that but idk if his acting company would want to take care of a solo debut (even if it&#x27;s one of those nugu &#x27;mandatory&#x27; ex-survival group ones) and if he still likes being an idol maybe he&#x27;d join em as i doubt anyone else would wanna take him in ðŸ˜­ again it&#x27;s extremely unlikely i know but it was a scary thought to have and think of as possible for like the 5 minutes that happened</p>

        <p>well i dont see what agency would want him with his reputation and his age and he doesnt seem keen on it hes lone wolf material. and honestly its simply the fact that jwgs finally trying to get to know gwk like he ignored him for a yr straight basically ðŸ˜­ gwk isnt making any extra advances either. i dont think hed redebut and he could sign with another acting agency if its rlly that serious for him</p>
