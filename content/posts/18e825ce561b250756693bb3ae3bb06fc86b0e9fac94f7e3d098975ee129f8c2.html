I&#x27;m an allin and a solo allin and most of my moots are asians. I&#x27;d say Hao, Hanbin and Yujin are all more popular among us asians. It is just the type of face and visuals most of us prefer. Even when I show zb1 to my friends, they all like these three too. And I see very few allins everytime zb1 go to Europe or america. Even we allins call him nugu in the europe sometimes and worry about him not getting cheers. He may be popular among europeans but I feel like members like gyuvin, ricky, gunwook would be more liked by them. If he is liked there then it&#x27;s good.</p>
