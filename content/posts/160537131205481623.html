        <p>Maybe it&#x27;s one of those cases where they had a lot of trainee debt and yuehua was like &quot;you&#x27;ll pay us back with the money you make from your activities&quot;?? everglow debuted in 2019 and were in a 20 month hiatus that ruined their momentum which was yuehua&#x27;s own fault... but it&#x27;s still so weird. Can&#x27;t the girls sue? I feel so bad for them. If the trainee debt theory is true, then the Tempest boys probably don&#x27;t get anything either. Yena, Ricky, Gyuvin, Hao, and Yujin should be &quot;&quot;fine&quot;&quot; because the izone/zb1 money should&#x27;ve been enough to pay all their debt by now, but I&#x27;m not sure about Seungeon and Yunseo. Is Evnne doing well? <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/160468877669782268" class="replyLink">/+r/160468877669782268</a></p>

        <p>the thing is everglow were fairly popular and they tour often so I believe they&#x27;ve made the money back + if they&#x27;re mostly from rich families they&#x27;re not accumulating as much debt. I think it&#x27;s just the case of a shitty company that&#x27;s rlly it lmao, my friend told me wannaone had to beg to get paid and look how popular they were</p>
