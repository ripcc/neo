        <p><a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/131743678262892515" class="replyLink">/+r/131743678262892515</a>i’m the anon trolling about mix and max but yes i agree their dance styles don’t really complement each other like all the tiktoks they did were much groovier which matt excels in so his dance lines look really good while hanbin looks a bit stiff except for the v lee jung cover. the steps has more technicalities and are sharp so hanbin looks better than matt there. yujins skill is a bit lacking until he fixes certain habit that make his dance lines look a little weird to me (sorry yujinie) unfortunately hanbin don’t really have a dance partner that could complement him well </p>
