        <p>wait now that you mentioned her fam thinking about it la is too broad like a bunch of idols always mention la so lets stick to shanghai and anything related to it because she did get a lot of hate from knets for her unknown chinese family history whether true or false so if she openly brings up chinese stuff i think thats it because why else would she knowing the hate she gonna get by doing so also idk i thought rumors said her fam is taiwanese? pls anons lets not get political im talking about the location geographically lets not start im tireddddd /+r/157616171317943067</p>
