        <p>Their title tracks parts are predetermined by the company regardless of the producer tho i think the members mentioned that already /+r/147008105899842518</p>

        <p>yea the company picks what songs they release but thats after theyre already made no? so kenzie as the arranger would still probably have more say than before</p>

      <p>oh ok I didn&#x27;t get what anon was saying this entire time I was talking about arranging the song so it&#x27;s not as high meaning kenzie has more say and might not do that but yea their parts seem to be predetermined they go in the booth just to do their lines</p>
