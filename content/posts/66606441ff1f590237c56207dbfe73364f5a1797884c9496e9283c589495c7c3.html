      <p>now that i&#x27;ve chilled out a bit, even tho it&#x27;s been announced that they have a collab stage with hybe groups literally a day after more report bs - which includes zb1 - has come out and that&#x27;s annoying, zb1 will (most likely, unless someone does voodoo on them) be fine like i think ppl will just feel bad for them or wonder why wakeone approved of this, it&#x27;s like how no one was hating on karina for the tiktok with sunghoon and all negativity went to him ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>treauxxxxxx I think for the most part it&#x27;ll be okay they do have bad luck but that&#x27;s been spent on this collab existing and missing mma for a tour date ðŸ˜‘ it just sucks that there might be animosity towards the attention they&#x27;ll get whatever it is I hope they can get good engagements or pity</p>
