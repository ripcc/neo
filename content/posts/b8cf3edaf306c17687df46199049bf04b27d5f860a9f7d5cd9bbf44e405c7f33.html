      <p>well new jeans careers are bleak unless they can get out of their hybe/ador contracts I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll end up going through a lawsuit but just like how mhj basically lost hers to hybe they could too. And while they&#x27;re under hybe finishing out their contract they&#x27;ll be shelved they were supposed to have a comeback by now and im pretty sure something for japan ended up getting scrapped? so in their speech hanni said &quot;newjeans never die&quot; they&#x27;re obviously really worried and everyone&#x27;s sad cuz they support them their careers could&#x27;ve been huge but they&#x27;re going through this battle it&#x27;s just sad</p>
