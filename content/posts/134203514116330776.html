        <p>I&#x27;m ngl the day of the crash was a lot quieter but it was still lively I spent a lot of my time in the hongdae area so it&#x27;s mixed with foreigners and it&#x27;s suuuuper lively and new years was lit almost everywhere I was at itaewon for the countdown which I expected to have a lot of foreigners but I was surrounded by only Koreans it was a little daunting ðŸ˜­ I saw there was a new years celebration in silence in honor of the victims so it just depends where u are but there have been tributes almost everywhere for the victims</p>
