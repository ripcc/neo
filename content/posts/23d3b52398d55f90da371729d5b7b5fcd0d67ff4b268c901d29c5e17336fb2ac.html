      <p>For example Minji, if she was in ITZY she would still fall behind Chaeryeong, Lia and Yeji when it comes to vocals. Chaeryeong and Yeji dancing is still better than hers. If she was on IVE she would also fall behind Yujin and Liz, maybe her dancing would save her but she would be a Gaeul 2.0 but with better dancing. If she was on Aespa, the vocal disparity between her and the others would be too much. Haerin and Hyein only have a nice tone, but so does Chaewon and that didn&#x27;t save her from getting tore up.</p>

      <p>the point is that no new jeans member would get called untalented because the there would still be someone worse than them itzy are not singers so the fact that lia would still be the worst dancer says something none of them are bad singers either so they would survive in aespa its not like giselle was always good or had difficult lines but the dancing would make a difference and thats what aespa gets hate for in ive again theres still worse members in singing and dancing they hold up alright ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
