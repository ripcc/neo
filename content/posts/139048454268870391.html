All I’ll say because requeef doesn’t like Haobin talk much, is the pfp to Hanbin multiple times after it being blank through college (seeing said pics myself and hao confirmed during a mass crash out between their solos… bruh it was crazy) and then calling Hanbin his true first love (came from same op who said the pfp rumor.) there’s tons of other things that I can’t talk about… but that in itself is very clear there’s at least romantic feelings involved. I’ve seen/heard lots of akgaes trying to start something about them with other people or bring up their past but it’s always been proven wrong/unreliable. They’re just mad straight girls who don’t have a chance with their bias. </p>
