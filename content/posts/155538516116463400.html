      <p>As Indonesian I assure you, we are busy stoning our governments because they keep making stupid decisions amongst many other things and the middle to lower class people, which build like 80-90 percents of our country got their economy hit from all directions from taxes to low as hell wage. Buying albums massively is the last thing we could think of right here /+r/154999377130377911</p>
