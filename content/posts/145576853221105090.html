        <p>Sorry to break it to you, but jgeonppangs are the smartest breeds amongst all. Even if they saw him, they will post in like... best case three days later, worse case next month.

      <p>Right. If he was out with member who got quite sane/gatekeeper cfans just like cgeonppangs then there is no hope. I wonder wtf is going on with geonppangs, is it a requirement to be the biggest gatekeeper ever if to be one? <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/145167739089277119">/145167739089277119</a></p>
