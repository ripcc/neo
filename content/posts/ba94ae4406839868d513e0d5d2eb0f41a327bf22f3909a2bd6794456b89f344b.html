      <p>no even the solos and akgaes are saying this message isnâ€™t about mama and theyâ€™re never reasonable lol no one likes to think about disbandment but theyâ€™re a little over halfway through now so of course thereâ€™s going to be insecurity over what his future career will look like. and the limited exposure comment is spot on to me I mean they donâ€™t even get sent to radio shows anymore let alone variety shows ðŸ¤· they really only have this window of time to build up their name because in most cases their popularity dwindles after. everyone wants their idol to be like the izone girlies but only 3 of them are actually seeing success thatâ€™s similar to what they had in izone. theyâ€™re the anomalies not the standard and other zb1 members have expressed concerns too just not as outright. his message is something he must have been thinking about for a while</p>
