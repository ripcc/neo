      <p>im the indo anon from the other day, yes the hall got downsized they were going to use 2 hall and only end up with 1 (also happened to ive in the same venue by the same promotor). txt also recently held a concert in the same one hall but i think there were overcrowding or something which is expected considering theyre bigger, but i think zb1 were doing fine with the audience count other factors that might contribute to hanbin saying that is that indonesians are so strict with respecting others and not disturb the view of those behind you... hence the no phone and banners raised above eye level and sometimes that extends to no lighsticks raised and no jumping around (except maybe if youre at the very back of the crowd) so that might result in the audience seemingly not hyped enough. the sections were also laid out flat(?) like there werent much of a tribune so the venue might look very dim from the artist&#x27;s point of view personally i had fun wished i got to jump around though but i wasnt gonna give up my close up center view</p>
