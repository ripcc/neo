      <p>zb1 eats up ALL their covers like ugghhhh not a single flaw tbh itâ€™s literally the management that fails to showcase this side of them when it comes to their own songs because they are in sync, their vocals are heavenly, their stage presence is top notch, the chemistry with each othet on stage is great they are literally shining</p>
