        <p>I’m not one to glaze hanbin esp not on platforms like this but anon you can’t be serious. I’ve seen most of wonys own fans prefer this duo and their visual chemistry. Also idk what you mean by washed because both looked good and both have very diffrent visuals. <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/131760246254426339" class="replyLink">/+r/131760246254426339</a></p>
