        <p><a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/139910363251693893" class="replyLink">/+r/139910363251693893</a> Anon I get it and I read his magazines too and I understand he wants to sing more but I refuse to play dumb and act like he doesn‚Äôt know what his sf is like, they all do. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs evil but he constantly says things with no context or reasons (like the accent thing) that just fuels his sf up and makes the other members get lashed. Also I get he‚Äôs the center and main vocal but in all honesty if rosins expected every single song to be hao and friends then they should have just stanned a soloist, like another anon said this song was predominantly rap and hao isn‚Äôt a rapper at all so of course he wasn‚Äôt going to have much lines and yet he still had more than the groups main rapper. </p>

        <p>Honestly like it&#x27;s a group at the end of the day being center means being a part of that and tbh being the biggest team player ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

      <p>this is my first survival show so im not too sure about everything else but p1 and p2 fans fighting has always been destiny i think the obsession with centerism is new with bopl/zbwon tho. the solo song plus zh being a foreigner made everything worse i think they also specified with bopl that 1st place is the center while its not exactly named in other shows and groups</p>
