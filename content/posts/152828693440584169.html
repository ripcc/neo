      <p>https://x.com/kchartsmaster/status/1893989421092937848?s=46 Announcing a center for a permanent group is so odd to me like sure loads of them have unofficial centers but actually labelling them that and that being a position definitely stemmed from survival groups</p>

      <p>ive always preferred the unspoken center position like if you have aura ppl will recognize it no need to label it but i feel like its because of karina shes been named center its so obvious in aespa and they wanna go down that track ig. also cuz jiwoos been getting more popular too</p>
