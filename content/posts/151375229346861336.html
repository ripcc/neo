        <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/meovvpics/status/1891700747718328735"></a></blockquote> i wonder if this means that she&#x27;ll take over sohee&#x27;s spot or if it&#x27;s truly just for this instance and they&#x27;re not thinking of a replacement mc at the moment. do u think she&#x27;s a good fit? i feel like i remember u mentioning meovv before so maybe ur familiar with her idk lol</p>
