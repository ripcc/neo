      <p>I dont even care about ive but I see wonyoung on my timeline all the time and rarely see yujin, yujin probably has the stronger core fandom and wonyoung is a bit weaker? Okay typing that just sounds stupid like someone&#x27;s who&#x27;s coping would say because that&#x27;s wonyoung were talking about ðŸ˜­ Okay they&#x27;re probably equal in core fandom but Wonyoung definitely has the bigger reach to non Ive fans so I guess it&#x27;s up to which type of fans starship values more? Yujin has bf stans I&#x27;m assuming = more money and wonyoung is more of an inspiration to younger female fans so they won&#x27;t spend as much? But at the same time even as a girl wonyoung is pretty hot and I doubt she has no bf stans so I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve been seeing this ive fiasco on my timeline the past two days and there&#x27;s definitely a noticeable bias towards yujin.</p>
