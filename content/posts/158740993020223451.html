        <p>pleaseee im seeing lots of ppl saying that &quot;how did her parents allow their child to date him&quot; or where they were but they probably didn&#x27;t even know üò≠ until it was very late ofc, he groomed her we don&#x27;t know how her family is either, groomers usually prey on the vulnerable ones, she definitely hid that, its not hard to hide it <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/158464336422198111" class="replyLink">/+r/158464336422198111</a></p>

        <p>Like we shouldn&#x27;t be assuming nobody knows anything and it&#x27;s obvious this was hidden they definitely were not parading this relationship around ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è let&#x27;s thinkkkkk he 100% controlled everything knowing how bad it would&#x27;ve looked he probably instilled so much fear in her</p>
