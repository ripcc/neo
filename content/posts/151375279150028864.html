        <p>speaking of yujin tho, he definitely invites it on himself, but the particular brand of babying that zeroses do w him is so funny to me when i take a step back and think...that is a whole 17 year old near 18 year old, he is a TEENAGER, nearly a YOUNG ADULT, i don&#x27;t buy the innocent act. i have a younger brother that age so i think the dissonance is especially real bc of that.</p>

      <p>this reminds me of when yujin&#x27;s cbar was making his custom mic and they were sending concepts for him to pick, and yujin kept striking all of them down and saying he wants a black mic. so the cbar would send new concept photos of pink shit and yujin would say no he wants a black mic and it happened at least 3 times so in the end yujin has a completely diamond encrusted all-pink mic with a bunny on it THIS POOR BOY IMAGINE BENG 17 WITH A PINK DIAMOND MIC I&#x27;D HATE MY FANS SO BAD <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/151040695094958927" class="replyLink">/+r/151040695094958927</a></p>
