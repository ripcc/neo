        <p>Not to defend allins but anon yk if the roles were reversed they would have had hanbinâ€™s head on a spike rn. I heard there could be other context and idc like that about either of them but the repo was blowing up and I saw it on my tl and id hope that not what he meant because it is weird to be saying that about a teammate/ close friend and to a fan at that ðŸ˜­ /+r/156952013110992000</p>

      <p>Zerocolas ask very targeted questions, they don&#x27;t care about the answer as they will try to get him to answer what they want or just interpret whatever he says to what they want it to be so... Y&#x27;all should realize these people are actual psychossssssssss the things they say about them both are just not normal it freaks me out ðŸ˜­ /+r/156958160459093142</p>
