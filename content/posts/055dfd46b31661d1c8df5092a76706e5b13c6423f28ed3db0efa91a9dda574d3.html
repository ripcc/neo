      <p>I actually feel like they&#x27;ve hit a peak rn that they haven&#x27;t add since pre crush like nobody usually cares about events like w but I&#x27;ve seen a crazy amount of hit tweets about them interacting and my non zeroses moots being into them, now would definitely be a good time to make them go live
For Ricky tho omg they haveee to push him this Japanese comeback, specifically in Japanese varieties but also just push him as a visual over Yujin in Japan, the amount of interactions he gets literally not doing anything (for example this tweet just describing him getting 17k) it would be such a waste not to use him rn, obviously what&#x27;s tricky with Ricky is that he also just does what he wants but he&#x27;s also someone I would make go live more often especially with gyuvin and Matthew because he&#x27;s great at bouncing off others and would get viral moments, he&#x27;s also gotten better at singing so he can be pushed a little more there too</p>
