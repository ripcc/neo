        <p>im ngl while u sometimes have a point about ricky maybe not wanting to go on pluschat/do certain tiktoks + i definitely don&#x27;t think sinophobia is the factor (or at least primary factor) in play + riyangis are indeed dumb af w the way they go about things, i think there is pretty ample evidence that he is treated exceptionally poorly under wk1 (recent example: dispatch post on weibo with only 8 members)</p>

        <p>I never once said rky doesn&#x27;t have real moments of mismanagement tho I&#x27;d always say every stupid complaint and act up by ryangis lessens the impact of things that actually matter like all the time ðŸ˜­ this is wkn issues are their second nature my point has always been that it&#x27;s less likely targeted and just an example of a poorly run company. Idk what this is all about but that does suck I&#x27;ve already got mention ab yh in my inbox but I woke up randomly and I&#x27;m bouncing so I&#x27;m not getting into that rn</p>
