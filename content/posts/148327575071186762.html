      <p>I’m not sure if it’s studio gl1de or the sbs one because both have a show that’s really similar. I know aespa enha txt and newjeans were on the studio gl1de one but if it’s ’school attack’ directly that name it might be sbs. Though it would be nice one of the og companies actually giving us an ot9 schedule. /+r/147164390175759231</p>
