        <p>From what I’ve been told in Korea you can self study for a year and then theirs a national
Exam period and you sit that exam and if you pass you get a bachelor’s degree. My understanding is that this is completely separate from his DIMA degree because he’s already finished and graduated that. But yeah not just for him but to legally practice as a psychologist in most countries including kr you’d need a masters and then a doctorate if your going into specific roles. Even a counsellor would need a masters. It’s a good degree to have though, it teaches alot that can be self applied and make you more self aware also idol life aside its a good degree for people who want to go into hr/ marketing / management so I guess you could say it’s a good thing to have / be studying as a leader <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/159018412079798929" class="replyLink">/+r/159018412079798929</a></p>

        <p>Ohhh self study so he&#x27;s not exactly in the course dang that&#x27;s hard if you can&#x27;t pace urself and that makes sense ofc he&#x27;s not going into the field but it sounds like a good supplemental degree</p>
