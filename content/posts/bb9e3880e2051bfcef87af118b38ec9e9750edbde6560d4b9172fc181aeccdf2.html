      <p>I feel like sm just wants to milk as much as possible from international fans cause domestically they&#x27;re basically past their peak? A lot of kbriizes already moved onto wish even before this so sm probably doesnt really gaf about their domestic money, plus they have a new sm bg coming anyways so cashing in the international money is kinda smart</p>

      <p>I know a lot of kbriize were moving but they still could&#x27;ve gotten bigger domestically theyre only a year old but seunghan back only means that they&#x27;re going back to their original plan. riize was never expected to make it big in korea and sm was going to make them the next big global thing (filming in la, kcon first appearance, spoiled a song in la, talk saxy targeting the western sound, the hiphop concept, etc.) so ig they&#x27;re back to it but i still think this was stupid because they&#x27;re basically banking international support on one member</p>
