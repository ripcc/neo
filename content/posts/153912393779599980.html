jiwoong - straight
hao - gay

matthew - straight but aggressively okay with gay people
taerae - this one is so damn confusing to me i&#x27;m constantly going back and forth between straight and bi but i think i&#x27;ve landed on bi ngl
gunwook - OKAY SAUR... yall might get me from this one but i think he&#x27;s questioned himself before fr fr. i can see him as straight but wondering if he might be into guys LOL
ricky - straight + strictly situationships
gyuvin - straight
