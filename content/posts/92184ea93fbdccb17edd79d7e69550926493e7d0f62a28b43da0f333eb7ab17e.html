      <p>The issue is that intl fans know very little about kfan culture and make things up and accuse every Korean person of being stalkers (and are hypocritical since they usually interact with what they consider to be stalkers on the daily) maybe I&#x27;m missing something but from the thread that rosin did she didn&#x27;t receive a dm from the saesaeng, she received an ask from a Korean fan sharing the pic on pushoong? It&#x27;s like if I shared a xhs ssng pic here and people started saying you&#x27;re a stalker</p>
