        <p>i wonder if dorm contract ending soon is real coz hao just confirmed the lease is under wk1 so its not them who rented a whole separate dorm also i doubt they would let the members apart especially before disbandment having foreigners in the group. Hao said he didnt plan to rent anything when the shippers asked if he has any plans to live with hanbin after lease</p>

        <p>oh i read ab that its the other way around no? wk1s renting it but the lease thing was always meant to be taken with a grain of salt lol. and i already said it was never a separate dorm ðŸ˜­ they have 3 different flats in the same complex how else would they be in each others places or sharing clothes</p>
