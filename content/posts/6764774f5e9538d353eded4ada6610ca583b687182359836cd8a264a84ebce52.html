      <p>surely they&#x27;ll perform the new japanese title track at the japanese concerts ðŸ¤” honestly not sure how to feel about that since january is 2 months away so the gap between a performance and it being released would be too much but also announcing it right before u have concerts in japan.. it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to NOT perform it then ðŸ¤” although maybe they&#x27;ll just perform only one story which is also on the album</p>
