        <p>Random but do you think suga will be able to promote with bts after they comeback? I heard none of them wished him a happy birthday and apparently they haven&#x27;t mentioned him publicly since his dui fiasco, kents want him out of the group but i think bts are too big to care about what they think lol</p>

        <p>im rlly curious to see how itll go bcuz didnt jk and namjoon unfollow e/o? maybe its cuz idk any armys but i feel like the world would move on if they scrapped the group promotions and continued doing solo work lolll. but if theyre rlly thattt money hungry i dont see why not theyre just releasing group stuff for profit so theyll probs continue w suga they dont even go on kent like that</p>

      <p>well actually 🤓☝️ i think j-hope mentioned him pretty recently and jk doesn’t follow anyone bc he doesn’t even have a personal ig acc he has a dogstagram acc which rm follows so 🤷‍♀️ id be way more surprised if they didn’t go through w/ a full group cb like u and anon said theyre way too big to gaf and they barely even go on k-ent 😭 <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/157615678076178862" class="replyLink">/+r/157615678076178862</a></p>
