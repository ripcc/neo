      <p>I watched meovv stage and ouwkay they kinda have that energy but I wonder if they are getting popular they would stop putting those energy like jennie. I love jennie during her rookie days cause she dance hard but not anymore &amp; my blink friend who attend several bp concerts said that jennie actually was being selective in which venue she will properly dance</p>
