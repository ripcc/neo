      <p>This the same thing hanbin fans (especially kfans) do on pann ijbol because most (keyword MOST i know some do actually trend but that&#x27;s not often) of the pann posts his chart account post about saying &quot;gained attention from knets ðŸ”¥&quot; it&#x27;s like 10k to 20k views with less than 30 comments and it&#x27;s so obvious fans are commenting and forcing the hype because they say the same thing all the time and sound like bots (you know what i mean lol) and they keep refreshing the link to increase the views ðŸ˜­ but yeah /+r/8c34e528bb</p>
