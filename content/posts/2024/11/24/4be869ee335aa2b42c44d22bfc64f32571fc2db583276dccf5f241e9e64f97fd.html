      <p>I just feel curious how come fans like those fansites, sunlightshb able to go to every single stop of zb1 tour without feeling bored. I went to their concert too sorry I&#x27;m not sh*tting on them I love seeing them and their performance but I just wanna know how they can stand to see the same performance for 6 - 7 times or even more like you must love the boys so much. Or it is just me who cant see the same thing over and over again</p>

      <p>i think if zb1 did a tour in america id probably go to 3 dates maybe 4 like itll get boring for sure but idk i think once youre hooked on the zb1coke you can do anything the rush that comes from a good seat will make u do anything</p>
