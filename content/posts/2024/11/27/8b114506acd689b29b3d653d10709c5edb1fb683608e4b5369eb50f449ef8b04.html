      <p>No. It was the hardware. They have it customized and it&#x27;s expensive because they&#x27;ll be changing lots of parts inside until Hao approves the sound. This is what Hao&#x27;s CBar said that Hao&#x27;s mic would be late since it&#x27;s customized unlike other mics that only changed the casing, not the hardware. /+r/1aff6b7e1f</p>
