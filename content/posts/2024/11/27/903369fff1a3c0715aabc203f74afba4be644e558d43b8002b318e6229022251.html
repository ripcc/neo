      <p>ok but i&#x27;ve been curious about this comment from that boys planet 2 post pannchoa translated for like a day now &quot;10. It&#x27;s not as fun or emotional as before... And the current ZB1 group combinations are called a miracle? These days, there are so many people with no basic skills, and the visuals are really going downhill&quot;.. i can&#x27;t tell if this is zb1 shade and they&#x27;re like being rude towards zb1, questioning people calling them a miracle, or they somehow mean it positively, saying they&#x27;re a miracle among the other male trainees out there ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>oh I saw this uhhh I didn&#x27;t take it as shade it just sounded like they were calling zb1 a miracle group cuz that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re known as now you have me questioning what they meant but when I read it originally I took it positively</p>
