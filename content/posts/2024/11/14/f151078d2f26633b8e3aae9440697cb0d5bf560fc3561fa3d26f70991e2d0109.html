      <p>Tbh from what ik they have seen it and are pissed but aside from the post coming from an obvious demographic (since only one half of the ship is being attacked) itâ€™s still on an anonymous site and blanket blame doesnâ€™t hit as much as targeted blame. So like itâ€™s not the same as finding out exactly who sent those asks and blaming them, what they point in starting a fight over something anonymous itâ€™s not like the person will ever feel the direct repercussions of it. Iâ€™m just shocked at how nasty and violent and graphic those death threats get especially when Iâ€™ve seen a couple in different cc say hb should be put in gaza to be bombed like at that point I donâ€™t even know how people can even adress or respond to that because it really does go beyond mental illness when you use the genocide of a whole race of people to wish death on someone whose never done anything</p>

      <p>treauxxxxx i think a lot of the reason they lost the pull they had on zeroses last year is cuz it was mainly blanketed blame theyd find one thing to be mad at and literally blame everyone like some dictators ðŸ˜­ especially with a page that has no other identity attached to it ghjffjgnfjdk that was my issue lol. but like you said this is anonymous so they also get no repercussions so you can just assume someone whod never say any of this out their mouth on the intenret or real life would take advantage of the function to say the nastiest shit ever its kinda like when people go on omegle to say slurs or crazy shit obviously not the same but yea youd be surprised just how dark and evil people get in the name of sending hate</p>
