      <p>Diff anon but those letter tiers are unreliable tiktok slop tbh unknowledgeable ppl just say it at one point and then everyone else runs with it and goes around saying it with no logical explanation there&#x27;s ppl out there saying ahyeon is a C mind u that is apparently the same tier as hao like GIRL BE SRS but for gawon I would say from what I hear from the radio show live performance there&#x27;s no shallowness and the fullness doesn&#x27;t have any tension either but you&#x27;re right there&#x27;s a lack of material so she could struggle with consistency but if she sings like that consistently then I would say she&#x27;s better than gunwook</p>
