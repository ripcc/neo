      <p>Bro tell me why i discovered how insane and far up in their delusions haobinists are through this &quot;ship war&quot; or whatever ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i thought most people were being unserious about this whole rps thing until i started seeing tweets like &quot;we are not shippers we are supporters, other shippers will never understand, everyone wants to gang up on US, this is different than just a kpop ship&quot; LIKW WHAHTDFNDF? NURSEEEEEEEEE i was genuinely weirded the fuck out and it seems like a thing too not all haobinists think like this obviously and those who do hate on the ones who are in it just for fun?? ðŸ˜­ this is another level of mental illness like i personally enjoy the ship sometimes just for the fun of it but these people are actually serious oh they&#x27;ll fr do smth drastic once they disband</p>

      <p>the essence of shipping has always been to somewhat believe in it or even fully believe in it its supposed to be lit and fun and anything you want it to be but icl i didnt realize people stanned them as an entity and went past shipping till a couple months ago i mean cool to each their own but i saw some of the tweak that came from that random ass ragebaity troll ship chart its insane like ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ there must be meth in the water nfghgfjkdfvbfndmb i cant understand it and i honestly dont want to but i feel like if youre stanning a ship and take it this serious you cant be that sensitive and go through waves of doubt and tweak on people for a either treating it like a regular ship or b not liking it or saying its not real</p>
