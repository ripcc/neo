      <p>I read thw Unreal&#x27;s blog. Girl is so funny but i&#x27;m so jealous she has no problem with money. Her only problem is time and chinese number. She&#x27;s 35th out of 200???? and the arrangement is based on how many sets of mistine they bought. Motherfucker bought too many that her friends apartment in china is filled with big boxes of mistine. How many did number 1 buy then????? Mistine sold 5000 sets for the fanmeet alone.</p>
