      <p>Why are people congratulating Gyuvin for prada ambassador in one of the dc gallery.... Is it real... It&#x27;s still very early in the morning so I can&#x27;t find any source about whether it&#x27;s real but if it is then it&#x27;s unfair.... How did he do that??? If he does get the ambassadorship, I hope he gets into huge scandal</p>
