      <p>sorry ðŸ˜­ but when I saw her again in the xhs queef linked earlier I just had to share cause shes actually starting to creep me out and wanted to know if anyone else noticed but I kinda feel bad I took some psychology course and she probably has childhood attachment issues and thats why shes carrying that teddy everywhere and stalking ricky to this extent O.O still creepy af tho</p>

      <p>I usually am so hyper focused on catching gunwook in a video I never notice but now I might have to cuz she&#x27;s definitely a character and yea same I can tell she has some attachment to the bear for whatever reason but it&#x27;s just crazy to see happening in video like zang</p>
