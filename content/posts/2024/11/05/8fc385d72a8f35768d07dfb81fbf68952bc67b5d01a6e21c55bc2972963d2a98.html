      <p>Is it just me but I feel like hanbin lost a lot of cfans as well other fans. Normally even if his cbar isn&#x27;t big they are very dedicated with their projects but now they didn&#x27;t even make any noise and I saw cbar group photo and there were very little people. And most of his big fansites from the debut/predebut aren&#x27;t as active anymore. I remember one of them who also likes taerae attend every fansign and fancall event but is no longer active. Allin, noir, suki, mate, 86400, inmydream all used to be his biggest fansites but they all suddenly went inactive. Noir, allin and suki are still there but they only come very rarely on their alt accounts. These are just the biggest ones, there are many small fansites too. He has more fansites who went inactive than the current active ones after ftp cb. Did he do something that we don&#x27;t know about? And about intl fans, most of them are inactive as well, he rarely gets hit tweets compared to other members and all his posts barely hit 1k likes.</p>
