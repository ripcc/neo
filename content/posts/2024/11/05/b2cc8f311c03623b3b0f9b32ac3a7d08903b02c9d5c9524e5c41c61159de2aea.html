      <p>side note, how&#x27;s gunwook&#x27;s popularity with cfans? like i was under the impression he was below yuehuaz+hanbin on that side and i could see that still being the case but perhaps there&#x27;s not as big of a gap as i thought? like the support he had for the concert was cute and it just feels like he had a reasonable amount of fans from the little i saw yk</p>

      <p>he is below them errr i wanna say hes maybe 6/7 its hard to tell the bottom 4 arent up. the gap is definitely there but gunwooks grown a bunch with cfans since this summer and its usually the dedicated type he attracts he had a good amount of fans at the concerts its easier to tell off performance cuz everyone screams for him when hes locked in #goat. idk if i see him entering the top 5 tbh hes gained so many cute cgpds im litty either way and his cbar loooooves him she organizes so much outside of china and always collabs with the base and dcgall even tho there were some issueshjvffhjdkshj but yea hes doing better than what i expected over there</p>
