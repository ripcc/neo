      <p>they probably have talked about not spoiling it so that’s why but i kinda need them to stop spoiling i want to be pleasantly surprised when the actual thing drops like they can spoil about a potential christmas song cover but don’t tell us what the song is gonna be 😐 it kills the excitement</p>
