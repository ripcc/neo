      <p>he didn&#x27;t say hanbin drove him around on a motorbike, at least that&#x27;s how most ppl i&#x27;ve seen have interpreted it... i&#x27;m pretty sure he said &quot;motorbike&quot; bc the zc kept asking what type of car they were in after he mentioned it being a &quot;rental&quot; so he was probably saying it in a sarcastic &quot;lol what type of car do you think? a motorbike?&quot; type of way. i think if hanbin could drive a motorbike we&#x27;d know since we know that he has a scuba diving license of all things lmaoooooooo</p>
