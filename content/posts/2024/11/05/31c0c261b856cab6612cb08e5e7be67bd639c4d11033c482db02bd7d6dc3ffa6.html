      <p>kinda random but i&#x27;ve been thinking about it for a while on zerose twt as much as i dislike akgaes and solos i can understand why they can&#x27;t stand shippers sometimes especially in this fandom where rps comes first and the idols&#x27; artistry and music comes second like damnngngjfjfjrj i&#x27;d hate it too if someone only remembered my bias existed when it comes to their ship, the engagment and clout on yaoi tweets compared to voting for the group and things that matter piss me off lol it gets worse when it&#x27;s the kind of extremely delusional shippers who start viewing other members as a threat to their ship and their only goal in the fandom is to convince everyone their ship is real like ... seriously what sets you apart from nasty akgaes atp? rps used to be fun and harmless in my days but i think zeroses in general don&#x27;t tackle this issue at all within the fandom they&#x27;re always loud about being ot9 and frowning upon akgae behavior / calling out toxic solos but i don&#x27;t really don&#x27;t ever see them talk about shippers who cross the lines .. anyway just a random thought i had you dont have to reply btw</p>

      <p>EFFING SAY THAT I&#x27;ve never been in a fandom where rps is taken so seriously and the fun is actually sucked out of it and I mean these people take it to seriously they purely stan for the purpose of shipping like.. that&#x27;s supposed to be second. And because of this it just creates to extremes where people completely villainize rps or basically ruin it the fragility of these people is so mad it&#x27;s one of the many things that just make zeroses so terrible and gives the zb1 stan experience a bad rep there is no such thing as moderation with these people....... CRACKED UP TO THE MAX!!!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s why I and most people I know really had to separate ourselves from the general public fan pool it just gets to a point where you can&#x27;t enjoy anything with people like this I think thankfully it&#x27;s gotten better with time but we&#x27;re still stuck in this ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
