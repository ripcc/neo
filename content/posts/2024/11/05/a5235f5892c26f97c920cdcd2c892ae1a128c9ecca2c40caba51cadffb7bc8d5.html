      <p>off topic but ricky and gyuvin speak konglish to each other right? I wonder if korean is more dominant than english since gyuvin isn&#x27;t that fluent in english iirc</p>

      <p>Yea but hmmmm the Korean would&#x27;ve probably been less dominant in the beginning? Ricky wasn&#x27;t that great before but now they might do more Korean idk</p>
