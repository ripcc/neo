      <p>i think after breaking up with his gf he is spending more time with them that&#x27;s why nowadays they are more comfortable with him. and boys are generally more forgiving than girls so it doesn&#x27;t surprise me. but there was a visible distance between him and the boys for a few months, right after the shibalgate</p>
