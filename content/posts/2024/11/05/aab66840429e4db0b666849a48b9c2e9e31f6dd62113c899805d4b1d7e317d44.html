      <p>This made me sad like I hope he didn‚Äôt feel guilty or bad like the fan support is for him not for fans to feel validated by him and if they only did it for acknowledgment then their heart was in the wrong place. I hope this doesn‚Äôt make him stop talking about fan support all together ü§ç</p>

      <p>yea i felt bad i was surprised he brought it up like i dont know how he knew he never talks about lurking or stuff but hes headstrong i dont think it would make him stop acknowledging anything. but indonesian fans are always kinda crazy like damnnnnn they shouldnt have been THAT upset. but i saw on xhs he visited the cbar cafe support thing twice after his live i think so hes good</p>
