      <p>Can I be honest. I saw a fansign video and people were all only screaming Hao and Ricky&#x27;s name with a little yujin. And he kept trying to do heart or whatever with Hao and tried to provide fanservice for fans which made him look uncomfy because I guess there weren&#x27;t many allins for him to do fanservice for. Probably why he was clingy to Hao there because he didn&#x27;t have many allins to do fanservice for and so he went on to give fanservice for the shippers. And I saw a weibo post saying that rosins were being rude and were screaming Hao&#x27;s name during every members parts and ments that some thought it was for them. I also saw them say that gunwook said the crowd is so loud today thank you but then rosins next to her were mocking like&quot;who was cheering you, it was only for our hao&quot;. There was definitely more rosins in the crowd probably why Hao didn&#x27;t want to do as many ship fanservice with Hanbin. These two are just so serious about providing fanservice</p>
