although wakeone should do something about this disparity. they should force the lazy members to post something like what other groups do. like they have schedules and posting is rotational to show fairness because if you&#x27;re a new fan and you&#x27;re seeing mistreatment narratives then you go to ZB1&#x27;S social media and see the difference in frequency, you might believe the narrative. Wakeone is there to manage them, not ruin them. Part if managing is making sure that fans are served</p>

      <p>I think they should tbh it&#x27;s definitely not top 50 concerns they should get to but honestly once intl fans have a narrative it will never ever go away even if it&#x27;s in your face which is kiiinda the case here but yea I feel like they gotta start making Ricky try a little harder. Like we got a year left FAKE IT JUST A LIKKLE PLEASEEEEE</p>
