      <p>damn anon I don&#x27;t think luckyz are that close at all but like queef said you can&#x27;t clock all their interactions as only yuehua instructions like yes we saw the shift after the dinner I personally do think that played a role in how things have gone since then but that doesn&#x27;t mean everything is manufactured like these are still two actual ppl theyll have normal interactions I feel like people take things to extremes here where its either theyre super close or everything is fake and they don&#x27;t know each other at all like lets find some middle ground https://x.com/4hyjdiary/status/1838924139597320554?s=46 also here&#x27;s an instance where the TMIs are actually opposite of what anon just said where yujin called all the other members cute and only did longer ones for gunhao, I don&#x27;t think TMIs matter that much when we&#x27;re analyzing member dynamics he probably just says what comes to mind /+r/5b3c8e8aad</p>
