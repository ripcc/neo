      <p>Yeah they double down for him idk how they managed to do it but they even got the koreaboo post on X taken down about the Swarovski thing because they were using his face on the cover despite him or his fans having nothing to do with it</p>

      <p>icl the 5th gen boy group game is just nastyyyy the level of trolling and hate is just insane but I feel like after witnessing so much you can tell the kinda things that don&#x27;t get blown out of proportion. Liek the Swarovski thing was a random audio clip alluding to a male idol fandom that could&#x27;ve been hyunjae (has more trolls) and it wasn&#x27;t either of the idols so not their faults really and op clarified but I heard that didn&#x27;t get as much attention but even then people except the akgaes trying to force it were mad at hanbin. So that in turn probably made it easier to koreaboo to take shit down probably with mass dming and clarification they&#x27;re washed af but that was some nasty work using his face</p>
