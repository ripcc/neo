      <p>You don&#x27;t hear anything like this from hao because he plays it safe and never pushes himself to sing out of his comfort range without shifting into a softer/brighter approach hao can&#x27;t even produce this note without shifting into a soft falsetto or cracking and it&#x27;s smart from him actually he knows his limitations but in mixed range belting head voice etc taerae wins taerae has always been the better technical vocalist even though the difference between them is small but all in all its the song that&#x27;s the problem its a weird song especially since woodz isn&#x27;t a very good technical vocalist but I guess since he has a natural high voice he chooses to do these type of songs where he can sing high notes a lot</p>
