      <p>I mean your anons hate everything about taerae we all know lol but dragging his voice is madness ðŸ˜­ he&#x27;s literally the only zb1 member who went viral multiple times in boys planet because of his vocals and he already got his second OST deal which, mind you, seems to be the main OST of the drama and he&#x27;s a rookie idol, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you want to drag his voice the Korean public loves his voice and that much is obvious lol</p>
