      <p>sorry anon but thats such a stupid take because why would his entire immediate family immigrant to the states just so ricky and his sis can go to school when its so common and easier for rich chinese families to send their kids alone to study abroad ðŸ˜­ the fact that his entire immediate family immigrated means they plan to stay here for good and how they took ricky out of a private school and transferred him to an international school where he&#x27;ll be surrounded by english and international students before coming to the states to make transitioning easier means they planned to leave years before actually leaving</p>
