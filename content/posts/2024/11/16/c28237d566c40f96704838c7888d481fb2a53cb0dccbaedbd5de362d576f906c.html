      <p>I noticed every time he&#x27;s spotted by himself outside shopping or w.e he wears the same thing he wears with us and without a mask like he doesn&#x27;t care to hide his day to day life by covering himself up or switching up his style so that he&#x27;s unrecognizable so yeah same I&#x27;m pretty sure what we see now is basically him. Just quiet who likes to do things alone and chill with a friend every now and then</p>
