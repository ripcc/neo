      <p>I know you&#x27;re tired of the discourse, but I&#x27;ll just say that hao doesn&#x27;t even talk about hanbin much during his lives and he frankly only talks about him when its in fansigns, which is why we all know he&#x27;s like the best in fanservice in zb1. I&#x27;d hate to think what everyone will say once they saw his cn gf stan repos gets translated because its actually crazier than haobin repos. Like it&#x27;s making haobin be friends with him reaaally upping the gf Stan fanservice. But I think this just shows that he&#x27;s a kpop pstan though and through since he knows how to accommodate all lmao</p>
