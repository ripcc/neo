      <p>A lot of these people are authors who want to receive comments about their work like absolutely none of them are going to other pages to send them hundreds of threats everyday I&#x27;m pretty sure Alice had some point on ns said it was daily and it&#x27;s been happening for over a year I think it&#x27;s really cruel to just say these people are weak and that they deserve it and are victimising themselves (especially since one of the ones who got it the worst is your friend) when honestly I&#x27;ve quite literally never seen this level of vitriol in any other fandom ever expect like the super racist swiftie like they were straight up saying they should get bombed in Gaza and get raped idk maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m from a Muslim country but the fact that people are pretending this is just normal hate hurts me because it&#x27;s soo dehumanising towards our lives</p>
