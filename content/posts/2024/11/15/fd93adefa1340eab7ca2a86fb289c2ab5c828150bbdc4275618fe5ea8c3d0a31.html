      <p>sweat was such a beautiful song I feel bad that the members pushed for it to be a pre release and it&#x27;s the worst received song they&#x27;ve ever put out ouh.. if sweat was released later it would&#x27;ve done so much better they&#x27;re stupid for shoving jiwoong in everyone&#x27;s faces as the first korean release since his scandal wow WE HAD DUDS RUNNING IT BACK THEN but yea idk I guess I really love them cuz we had to live through it and see what was next</p>
