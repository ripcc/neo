      <p>i thought crosins would spin the fucking block on minghao FDJSFGHFDJIGHF NOT A DAMNNNNN THING but honestly when youve been in the game that long time does the burying for you the internet has changed so much its probably near impossible to dig stuff up from 60 B.C. like hao is easier to track down his socials are only a couple years old and he was known before he debuted so people def kept tabs on him like idk shit ab minghao but im sure he was a bum. its crazy i met this girl who has acquaintances who know of hao</p>
