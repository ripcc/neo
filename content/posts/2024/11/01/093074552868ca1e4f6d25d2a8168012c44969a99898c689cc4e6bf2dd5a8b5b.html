      <p>I thought planet b was happening towards the end of 2025 and that weâ€™d have ages before weâ€™d have to realistically start thinking about that new bg being a threat. But now Iâ€™m finding out the auditions are being released after kingdom finishes so some time this December ðŸ˜­ https://x.com/globalplanetb/status/1845824229100683505?s=46 i mean it makes sense since bp auditions finish in aug 22 and then started filming at the end of that year and planet b auditions just finished in Aug 24 but why does it feel like that went by really quickly.
Now haoâ€™s message makes a lot more sense to me about the nerves of the new survival shows, this new group will be formed by next April and quite frankly if they do well wakeone possibly might back burner zb1, idk maybe thatâ€™s why heâ€™s anxious about all these new survival shows. To be a realist if there extension looks unlikely then this group is essentially being formed as their replacement and they probably feel it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Iâ€™ll actually tweak out if they have any of the boys mc or special mentor it though because I think itâ€™s a new level of mean to have them work on a group thatâ€™s going to be replacing them</p>
