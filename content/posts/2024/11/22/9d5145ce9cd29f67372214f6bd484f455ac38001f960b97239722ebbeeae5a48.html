      <p>you can’t tell me that mnet was not humiliated when zhang hao rightfully won his center position now they are basically splitting them to prevent that from happening again plus try and get $$$ from chinese fans but they will obviously fail because first of all boys planet was a fucking FLOP in China they don’t give a single flying fuck about korean survivals and only joined the fandom because hao was the first chinese center which was after the finale. What mnet is also not getting is that they weren’t the ones that made boys planet a success but the pool of trainees they had that year that made it a success but they are so far up their own ass to recognize that, it’s never going to happen again.</p>

      <p>I think it&#x27;s more about that market and less about having another global center just cuz they&#x27;re not closing off the participation on the k/c front. But genuinely I&#x27;m confused as to how they&#x27;re gonna make this work like cfans are gonna rock with a Chinese group made from a Korean channel THEY DGAFFFFFFFF but the fact they&#x27;re doing these weird concepts is killing me like they&#x27;re never ever gonna get such a good trainee crop like that or the pure theatrics they presented like wow I&#x27;ve never watched a survival sho forreal but this was theeee most goated and the fact that they&#x27;re just dragging it through the mud making everything about zb1 2.0 is just blowing me</p>
