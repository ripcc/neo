      <p>hmmm do you think its okay to bring banners with other artists face on it on exclusive solo fanmeets? its like bringing other idols lightstick to someone elses concert but for me its okay if its concerts bc there are a lot more people but with solo fanmeetings that only has a limited number of people i think its kinda disrespectful</p>
