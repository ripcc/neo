      <p>Obviously agree with anon but Im kinda annoyed by people being like see wakeone don&#x27;t care they&#x27;re abusive (true) you&#x27;re FUCKED UP if you want extension it just comes across as fake woke to me because if you cared about that you wouldn&#x27;t spend money on K-pop period they quite literally legally do not even view idols as workers like that&#x27;s all companies /+r/5f3b3bb90d</p>
