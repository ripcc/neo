      <p>Ok so Iâ€™m actually down for the jebs to disband solely for the fact it means hao-Hanbin-Yujin will no longer be the members only pushed. Youâ€™d think Iâ€™d want to Stan them again if they get a contract elongation if Hanbin and Hao are the only members getting consistent dance solos and hosting, variety, or modeling shows for the next like 5-7 years? Yeah no. Itâ€™s limiting the potential of the rest of the group and idgaf if they won 1&amp;2 on boys planet anymore. If I see their popularity divide continue to grow and ZB1 become like Astro with Eunwoo being the only one well known and no one gaf about the other members like Sanha Iâ€™d kms. Iâ€™m pro-disbandment just for this. May their situation hopefully be their own version of popular groups/solos post survival show group disbandment like Le Sserafim (pre-Coachella), IVE, Yena, etc. If somehow fuckass starship ent. locked in and used the fuck out of Wonyoung and Yujin to make IVE humongous Iâ€™m praying other companies will do the same with the other members, maybe even buy out some of the contracts ðŸ¤ž</p>
