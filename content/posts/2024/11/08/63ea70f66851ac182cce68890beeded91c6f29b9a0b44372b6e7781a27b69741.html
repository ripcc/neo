      <p>i think there might be a time limit when it comes to editing tweets but idk. this is random but i do remember seeing sunlightshb repost a translation she did in order to fix it bc she said she wasn&#x27;t able to edit it and i&#x27;m pretty sure she has premium and hides her blue checkmark</p>
