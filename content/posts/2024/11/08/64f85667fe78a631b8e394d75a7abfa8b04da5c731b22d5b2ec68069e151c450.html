      <p>i would&#x27;ve thought hanbin would be thought of as a &#x27;tofu&#x27; visual since he&#x27;s pale and people consider him a pretty standard visual, like more of the yoona type than the nana type iykwim, but maybe that would be more around debut era when he had a bit more weight on bc now his features look sharper???? idk</p>
