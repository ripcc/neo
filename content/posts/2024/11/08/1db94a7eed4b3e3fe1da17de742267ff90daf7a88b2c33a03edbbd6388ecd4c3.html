      <p>true, i don&#x27;t think her being chinese or not has any relation to getting variety gigs. i think starship is deliberately suppressing her because they want yujin to be ive&#x27;s face. wonyoung most probably will leave starship after her contract ends where yujin is more loyal to starship</p>
