      <p>Oop I get that for some words you really don&#x27;t know and they&#x27;re widely used although that is in itself an issue my beef is whenever I see these accounts fighting (tbf I only see rosins do it) they completely talk in aave even though they&#x27;re usually sea and you can tell it&#x27;s because they think it gives an image of toughness like why do you not use fucking singlish slangs when you&#x27;re mad why only aave ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ ugh sorry ik it&#x27;s not directly zb1 related but it drives me crazyyy</p>
