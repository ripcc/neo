      <p>I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s full but she used to appear on a lot more variety in the past no? I feel like it kinda stems from the wonyoung favoritism thing also and yujin had an exploooooosive reaction to her on variety but the disparity&#x27;s still off her origins which are unconfirmed shouldn&#x27;t hinder her from broadcast she&#x27;s big enough to be invited to almost everywhere idk</p>
