      <p>Diffrent anon I don’t think he hates himself or his past or is ashamed but I think he realises that entering this industry means he can’t be who he used to even if he wants to and that if he wants a certain type of idol life he has to shut away big parts of himself.
I disagree with the sentiment he hates himself for it because he wouldn’t continuously mention that he’s proud of his past (linked to queee spaces) or make comments that allude to being queer but I do think there’s a pressure on him from the industry/ his fans and ultimately manifested into him imposing it on himself that he needs to present a certain way.</p>
