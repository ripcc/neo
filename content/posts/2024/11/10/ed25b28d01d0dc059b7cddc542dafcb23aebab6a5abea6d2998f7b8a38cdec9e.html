      <p>hanbin is an extremely emotional person anon.. he&#x27;s a damn good leader but his emotions definitely drive his actions and he does things like this or addresses them without thinking through first. i seriously doubt there&#x27;s any manipulation or calculation from his actions, and i don&#x27;t think he feels sorry for himself either he knows he&#x27;s loved. he is smart but he&#x27;s young and still learning, it seems like he&#x27;s gotten better at not reacting rashly these days though</p>

      <p>i think now that ive learned more about hanbin my opinions different from april i definitely wouldve agreed a lot more with anon back then but yea hanbin is smart but i would attest that more to his extreme carefulness hes so cautious that it hurts sometimes and thats where i think people get the idea of calculatedness when he does something odd i definitely thought so but right hes definitely emotionally driven and its why his fans can take advantage of him sometimes and agree hes gotten a lot better i would kinda get annoyed before but hes learned a lot</p>
