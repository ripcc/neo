      <p>I saw him talking abt the drama during his live too and thought he did great researching abt one of the trending dramas there and especially Esther yus since aside from the fact shes pretty and famous she&#x27;s the type to definitely shout you back if you shout out her so when i saw his official post I saw what was coming maybe thats why the ost talk is unbelievable to me</p>
