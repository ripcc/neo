      <p>what i understand from supadupamy&#x27;s comment and quote is that the dinner was on oct 24 late at night around 1 am, and there was emca that day, after emca hanbin came to live and ate dinner ( so imo this almost ed patient would not go to have a second dinner or drink) , next day zb1 had early morning flight so even jiwoong should not have time to socialise that late at night</p>
