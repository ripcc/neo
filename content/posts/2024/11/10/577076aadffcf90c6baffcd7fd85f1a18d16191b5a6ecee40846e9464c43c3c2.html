      <p>A bit random but I was deeping the zb1 contract and I think one smart way they could move forward is do what x1 were supposed to do and have their solo stuff managed by their og companies ( im sure most of it is anyway) but I think having wakeone strictly manage only the group stuff would be better</p>
