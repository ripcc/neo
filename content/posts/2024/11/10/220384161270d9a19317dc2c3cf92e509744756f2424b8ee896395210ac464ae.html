      <p>i dont know about it being first posted during boys planet era because i wasnt in the fandom back then. the post i saw was around crush era, the days where kfans would leave the fandom to be exact. you know how there are always a few fans with the mindset of &quot;if i dont stan xyz nobody should&quot; and then they post things they normally wouldnt if they were to continue stanning the idol. kallins are very good at making posts dissapear, i gotta give them that</p>
