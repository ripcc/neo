      <p>Nah itâ€™s because he directly contact the person who posted it and they didnâ€™t mention hanbinâ€™s name but he wanted to double down on chaeyeon being there but he couldnâ€™t post the screenshots without exposing that hanbin wasnâ€™t there and his first post was wrong + the mass lashings from kallins ( funnily enough I saw kzeorse in general lashing him for mention hanbin but no one said anything about jw being mentioned ðŸ˜­) so he apologised so he could keep up the other post</p>
