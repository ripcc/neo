      <p>tbh even if u go to the outskirts with no tourist I think it&#x27;s okay because u might get some stares especially from them old ahjummas but I think it&#x27;s more of a curiosity typa thing because they never seen a dark skin person before ðŸ˜­ my friend went to beijing to scout schools and on her last day they decided to go to the country side and these old grannies kept looking at her so at first it looks like some racist shit so my friends chinese friend went up to them ask them whats up and theyre just old and shes the first black person they saw irl and had no racist intention just pure innocent curiosity ðŸ˜­ and i think u can tell when someone is actually racist and thats when u clock them</p>
