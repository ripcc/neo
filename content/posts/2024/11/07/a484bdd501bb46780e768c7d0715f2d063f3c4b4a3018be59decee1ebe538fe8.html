      <p>this is another convo tho cause og anon was asking if they gonna dip after his sis graduates which I answered seems highly unlikely knowing how much they prepped before to come to the states and how it wasn&#x27;t a sudden impulse decision, even in a business standpoint it doesnt make sense because china 10 years ago is way different than 20 years ago, their economy is prob better than ours. Also if anything if they didn&#x27;t like the murican way they coulda dipped long ago cause their schools are probably better than ours too ðŸ˜­ like u really think they staying here for some ocsa high school diploma ðŸ˜­ but yeah maybe in 20-30 years when his parents made all the money they want and decide to retire and live a life back in china then yeah they could go back but rn they aint dippin just from everything we know cause their intentions all points to staying permanently.</p>
