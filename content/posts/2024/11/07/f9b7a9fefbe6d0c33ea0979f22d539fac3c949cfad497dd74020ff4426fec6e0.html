      <p>not to be nosy but are u solo travelling 🧐 i’m a different anon and i’ve been to korea before and wanna go back at some point but idt i’d have anyone to go with. went with my family last time but don’t think they would be bothered going again ya know, my parents weren’t the biggest fans and i’ve never travelled with friends but i just know that’d be hard af to organise and who even knows if they’d wanna go but i wanna go backkkkkk. just wondering about the solo travel thing bc i do have the prior experience of going to korea, the transport and even tho i know hardly any korean i could probably make it around but i’ve also never travelled to another country on my own before so i’m a lil scared about doing that</p>
