      <p>Is america different cause dual citizenship is a thing. You can apply for another citizenship, you’ll have 2 passports. They could still be citizens in china and residents in America but they likely have dual citizenship at some point if Ricky says he’s American Chinese</p>

      <p>China doesn&#x27;t recognize dual citizenship I&#x27;m not sure if you have to renounce it like you do in Korea ok I just searched it up and yea before she can naturalize as a US citizen she has to renounce her Chinese citizenship first so you can&#x27;t be both she can restore her Chinese citizenship but idk I don&#x27;t see why she&#x27;d go through all that when green cards and permanent residency are livable. Ricky says he&#x27;s American or from la he doesn&#x27;t really say he&#x27;s American lol because he spent his formative years there it shaped him so he can claim it</p>
