      <p>japanese release schedules are usually weird and the songs all get released before the album officially comes out so i think we’ll probably get at least one of them this year</p>

      <p>Yea I know but it&#x27;s never released more than two weeks prior to the album release so the titles def coming out earlier mid ish January but 2024 seems like a stretch I would be fine if this was a regular group but zb1 only promote for 2-3 weeks of their comeback eras and we never see them again SOMEBODY HOLD MEEEEEEEE</p>
