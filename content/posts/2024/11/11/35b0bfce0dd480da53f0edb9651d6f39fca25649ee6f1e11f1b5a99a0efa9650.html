      <p>Republicans crying because their Democratic family cut them off is reminding me a lot of white woman tearsâ€¦ itâ€™s because a lot of them have overlap in the way that they both are pick meâ€™s and think theyâ€™re are the innate exception to every rule and that no consequences will ever come their way and think that they can get away with more. Republicans can kick rocks bwahahaha</p>
