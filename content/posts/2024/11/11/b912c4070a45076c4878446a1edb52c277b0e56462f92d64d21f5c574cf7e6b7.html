What I realised from wb fights is that rosins are all bark no bites they create all these issues for Hao (these posts has hundreds of thousands of likes and it was number 1 trending topic all day) but they can&#x27;t defend him or fight for shit this is the second time 8stars absolutely rip into Hao while the only thing they can say is that he&#x27;s ugly these women actually have rocks for brains if their goal is for Hao to one day be a top star in cent it&#x27;s quite literally never happening with things like this happening every two days and them not being able to defend him or hold any kind of accountability for their fandom for now their behaviour only affects Hao but if it keeps it will one day affect the group ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI was so pissed at them yesterday</p>
