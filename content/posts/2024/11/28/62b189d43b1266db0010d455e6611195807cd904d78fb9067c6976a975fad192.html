      <p>Hi Queef I come here to say last good-bye to you. I&#x27;m deactivating my Twitter and other accounts, and unfortunately, clearing my browser history and cache, so I&#x27;m not able to find your account. I&#x27;m Yujin biased, ot9 stan, but today I feel helpless. Some tweet about Ricky thumbnail getting into Pannchoa, and there is blood bath in the comment section. Yujin is getting dragged badly. I think Ricky&#x27;s thumbnail concern was valid, but it blew out of proportion. I can&#x27;t handle this negativity. I might be weak that internet comments are affecting me, but I&#x27;m thinking about leaving social media. I rarely post anything here; I love your tea. I think you are a fantastic human being, and I hope you and your followers in this feed have a beautiful future ahead. Thank you - ðŸ˜Š</p>
