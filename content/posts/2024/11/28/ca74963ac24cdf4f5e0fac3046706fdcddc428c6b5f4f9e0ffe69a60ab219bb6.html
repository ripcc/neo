      <p>not to spark an argument but i&#x27;m curious you seem to think hao doesn&#x27;t face any kind of discrimination or sinophobia from the company or the industry do you actually believe that or you just don&#x27;t care that he does because he&#x27;s the center and has many fans and it isn&#x27;t that big of a deal since you&#x27;re always downplaying any kind of complaint coming from his fans no matter what it&#x27;s about (for the ridiculous or silly complaints i understand tho)</p>

      <p>what am I supposed to say at every complaint?? I&#x27;m sorry but I just can&#x27;t bring myself to care about things that won&#x27;t stop or don&#x27;t upset me like genuinely I&#x27;ve done it too much to the point idc anymore and I&#x27;m not gonna waste my time discussing the obvious everyone else does it enough and I prefer to have a kii ðŸ˜­ I&#x27;m not downplaying like I&#x27;m sorry if my manner and tone comes off that way but what am I supposed to say about mishaps or about lines or schedules and it&#x27;s not like I change anyone&#x27;s minds believe me people make it known LOL like idky this is supposed to be at the forefront of my opinions or concerns like maybe if you caught me 6 months I would&#x27;ve got nitty gritty BUT THAT SHIT AGED ME IM OVER ITTTTTTT I can discuss but im not putting anything more than i need to into it also I&#x27;ve been traveling all day I didn&#x27;t even know the thumbnail issue started with hao until later like can everyone be calm fnfnnfnfmmdmd A JOKE WILL NOT KILL YALL</p>
