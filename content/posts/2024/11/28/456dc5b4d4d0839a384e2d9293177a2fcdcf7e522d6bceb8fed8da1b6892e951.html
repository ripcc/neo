      <p>https://x.com/mydearnine/status/1862087285627592710 how long was this guy a trainee bc there&#x27;s not been many male idol survival shows in recent years. first thought was produce x 101 but like idk (also i don&#x27;t think he was in yuehua when woodz and all that went on so if he tried for it it was probably with dsp since some of them went on and dongpyo made it to x1)? and the other survival shows i can think of are under nineteen or loud but üßê</p>
