      <p>ewwwww i hate when these subfandoms/solos/akgaes talk about fandom reputation or all this talk about &quot;we&quot; like their fandom is one single entity with one opinion like it&#x27;s giving cult vibes. also they&#x27;re always thinking they&#x27;re on the same level as their favskmksdfds</p>
