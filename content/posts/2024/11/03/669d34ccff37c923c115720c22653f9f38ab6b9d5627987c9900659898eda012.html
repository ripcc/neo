      <p>now interestingly, w1 seem to slowly start pushing haobin more ; from showing zc fan support on their IG story and behind, allowing the live to happen, the fact that they&#x27;ve been mentioning each other in lives or alluding to each other in some ways, I&#x27;m not sure what it is in particular but there&#x27;s a slow but noticeable marketing shift surrounding haobin, this make me wonder if du hua really has changed her mind around zb1 but I guess we will have to see how things keep moving I do think these two marketing changes are very obvious and sudden in both cases which makes me think it&#x27;s very much related to behind the scenes contract extension/agreement discussions (as we all know yh has power over zb1) I think its definitely something to keep an eye on
Sorry it&#x27;s long you&#x27;re free to ignore I&#x27;ve just been very curious about this while thing for a while and to me it looks like a change of plans might have happened in the internally</p>
