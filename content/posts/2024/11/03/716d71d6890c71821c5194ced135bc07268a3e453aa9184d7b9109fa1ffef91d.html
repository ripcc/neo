      <p>i mean i feel bad for them if they&#x27;re sad about not getting acknowledged but the point of fan support is for the idol to feel loved and also i think overall zb1 acknowledges so much individual fanbase support already like they&#x27;re actually rlly in tune with a lot of what&#x27;s going on it&#x27;s just going to vary for each stop</p>
