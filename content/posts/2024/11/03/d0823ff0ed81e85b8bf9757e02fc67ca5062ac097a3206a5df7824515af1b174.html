      <p>I donâ€™t think he will fall into nugudom but I can see a lot of his fans leaving if we&#x27;re talking about his cfandom, then this would only happen if he redebuts in a group, isn&#x27;t the center and is kept in the basement. contrary to popular belief, crosins aren&#x27;t that hard to please. all they want yh to do right now is give him resources and take legal action against his antis and rumor mongers, that&#x27;s it. even with all the things they complain about and all the conspiracy theories they come up with, they are willing to spend millions of yuan on his activities despite knowing that part of that money will go to w1 and yh. the reason some of his cfans rested or are inactive is because of his lack of exposure, they got tired of being so angry and seeing him go through what they perceive as &quot;sabotage&quot; over and over again and that exhausted them. so all yh needs to do is make him a soloist and give him many gigs, chinese gigs, korean gigs, osts, anything really and crosins will do the rest. he&#x27;ll be fine as long as he gets exposure, I mean his supertopic gained like 50k+ followers after running man. yh doesn&#x27;t even need to be perfect, all the cfandoms of yh artists have come to terms with yh&#x27;s mediocre management and ignore their grievances with the company as long as yh gives their favs resources and sues their antis which is like the basic thing any company should do.
his international fandom is another thing, there I can see many of his fans leaving whether he becomes a soloist or rebeduts in a group because ifans just aren&#x27;t that loyal compared to cfans but who knows? if yh ships him to c-ent, then I can see him gaining more sea fans since from what I&#x27;ve observed much of c-ent&#x27;s international fandom is made up of sea fans but he&#x27;d lose a lot if not all of his kpop ifans for sure. the best case scenario would be to find a balance between c-ent and kpop.</p>

      <p>Oh I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;d still have a strong fanbase but it takes a lot to reach 500k+ idk ab all that and yea his international and korean bases would drop and it really depends on his treatment his rollout and the timing I just doubt things would be totally satisfactory but hey who knows</p>
