      <p>I&#x27;m so fucking tired of this lame ass tour and we have 6 more Japanese dates left.. PLEASE JUST KILL US ALREADY I saw the trailer I would say it&#x27;s on par with gsb it&#x27;s nothing better than zb1 but it&#x27;s just so unfair that zb1 started with booboo on a plate ðŸ˜‘ this is upsetting me and then we got planet b great</p>
