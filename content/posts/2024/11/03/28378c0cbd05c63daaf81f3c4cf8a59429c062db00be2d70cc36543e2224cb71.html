      <p>Diff anon and I think the fkboy image is just cause his physical features just naturally look cold and his idol persona. Knowing his personality and how hard he gatekeeps his true self to a select few he gives me straight traditional vibes like what queef first said, as in date to wife up and grow old with and can get freaky with her LOL</p>
