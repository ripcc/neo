      <p>Because the vast majority of people are rosins which is why you hear some of the most outlandish retarded takes on here + why schizo trolls like Katie and melodi hang here..I stay quiet but it&#x27;s very obvious that a lot of people here are only in rosins circles only because there&#x27;s a lot of half truths and misinfos, not just about the other members but about hao himself that are spread here</p>

      <p>yea I respond to a lot of jarring stuff it keeps it entertaining ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è we cant really treat my page like it&#x27;s on some official obligation lol I have my own history and control over things. I don&#x27;t see the point in discussing with only one kind of view I&#x27;m willing to hear anything out and since we&#x27;re running on opinions there&#x27;s no solid gauge like what ur trying to imply. hao fans aren&#x27;t as rampant here mostly because they dislike me and i block people everyday and they&#x27;re not the only people who dislike hanbin but it&#x27;s fun regardless ayeee</p>
