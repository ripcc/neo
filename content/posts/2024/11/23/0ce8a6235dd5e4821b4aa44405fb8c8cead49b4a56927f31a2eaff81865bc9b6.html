      <p>diff anon but yujin improved a lot since last year, rmb when he was licking his lips at mma ðŸ˜­ i think the problem with him is he doesnt get immersed into the character/ song and just plays the pretty role so i think once he improves on that he&#x27;ll def be a great performer /+r/cde8659715</p>
