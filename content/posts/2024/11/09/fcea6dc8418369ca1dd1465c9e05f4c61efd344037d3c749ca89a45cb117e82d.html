      <p>I saw the other video from inside the airport there was a lot of staff and security waiting for him this was just them trying to get him in the actual building ðŸ˜­ and he had like 5 personal staff with him which in reality if the â€˜fansâ€™ had any semblance of respect for him should have been more than enough like even enha as a group with their crazy mobs move with about that many staff</p>
