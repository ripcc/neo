      <p>http://xhslink.com/a/qhqltT5eNDrZ i dont think they expected to have that much people still waiting outside bc there were already a lot inside and the airport staff got everything under control there they put barricades and all but having 2-3 bodyguards is stupid imagine if all those people inside just decided to fuck it and mob them ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
