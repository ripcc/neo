Yeah no i get it but the fatherless takes were so brain dead because you have to remember what happened to his mom&#x27;s side business when it got leaked so it just makes sense for them to keep it extra quiet about their dad because it&#x27;s obvious his dad business isn&#x27;t some simple small shop they can easily close down like big money is on the line</p>
