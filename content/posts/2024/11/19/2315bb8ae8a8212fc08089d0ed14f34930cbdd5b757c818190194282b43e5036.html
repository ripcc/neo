      <p>/+r/344e87d819 this reminds me of this matthew fanboy who went to a fansign in korea and brought up shelby to hanbin like he said something very sweet but then added that right at the end and it ruined the video for me ðŸ˜­ so yeah all these fansign/fancall ppl must become mutuals with each other, i wish i knew his @ but he&#x27;s probably friends with this minnie girl too lmao. but also i vaguely remember coming across this girl&#x27;s tweets before and not to be insensitive or anything but i think she goes to korea and all these fansigns/fancalls in order to fill a void like i remember seeing tweets implying that she&#x27;s very depressed and the way i&#x27;ve seen her talk about these types of events and stuff it&#x27;s like damn girl.. it&#x27;s like a drug to her (and probably these other ppl)</p>

      <p>Lmaooo I rmbr that video I can&#x27;t rmbr what was said exactly it has to have been smth off cuz I think in general bringing up a friends okay. And yea damn they&#x27;re def connected the anon who was in korea for sometime said that a lot of the intl zeroses there are kinda weird so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it was smth like that all cliqued up all cracked up. but I meannnnnnn it has to be I went through her EXTENSIVE thread of interactions and overall moments with her biases she Stan&#x27;s a lot of groups and does sooo many fancalls and fansigns for all of them and travels to korea frequently it probably is some kind of drug because her life certainly revolves around it interesting tho</p>
