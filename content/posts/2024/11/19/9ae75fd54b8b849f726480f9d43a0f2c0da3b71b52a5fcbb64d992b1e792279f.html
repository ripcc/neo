Anon, yours is since bp. Mine is since his teens and it&#x27;s not weird. look at how his ears changed. My friend had his ears elongated too since he has ugly ear-shape but he can&#x27;t use dangling earrings now in fear of getting them stuck in his clothes and pull his ear.and what&#x27;s wrong with getting your ears done?</p>
