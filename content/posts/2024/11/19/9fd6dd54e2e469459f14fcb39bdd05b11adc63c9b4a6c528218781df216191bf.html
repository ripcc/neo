      <p>https://x.com/ksixrenine/status/1858698903266488571?s=46 That one boy Guanlin from Wanna One became a civil servant in Taiwan at just like 23, good for him. Itâ€™s kinda nice to see a kpop idol get out as a young adult and work a fulfilling career. He made his bag and dipped and made a career. Good for him</p>
