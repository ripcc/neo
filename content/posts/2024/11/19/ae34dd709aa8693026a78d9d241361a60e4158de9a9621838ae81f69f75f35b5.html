I follow supadupa and I got a notification that they are speaking in this space and I just simply entered anonymously and found that supadupa already left and there were only 5 priv accounts... 4 are zeroses or solo stans (2 yujin, 1 taerae, another probably yujin stan too)and one non speaker nct wish fan. But they were definitely having some tea... They talked about yujin the most. Made ssibal jokes about Kim Jiwoong (which was the only thing I could understand).</p>
