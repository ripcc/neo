I actually think they are in new dorms because from the bit we saw in Matthews pancake live it doesn’t look like the izone dorms and fromis lived in penthouse bit of the old pledis building so it’s definitely not that dorm since the members have mentioned neighbours. Since Kepler got a new dorm I assume zb1 got a new one too, I wonder if it’s in the same complex ?</p>
