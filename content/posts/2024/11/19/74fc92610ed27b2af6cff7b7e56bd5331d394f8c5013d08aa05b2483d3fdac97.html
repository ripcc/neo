There&#x27;s just quite literally no anime with 0 weird scenes or themes like I&#x27;m not exaggerating so if someone asks you for anime rec or if you&#x27;re an anime fan literally any of your recommendations can be exposed in this wayðŸ˜­ haikyuu is safe tho Gunwook made the right choice</p>

      <p>Right like u just have to be an avid anime watcher to understand you almost become numb to it I wasn&#x27;t even really surprised by the dandadan stuff jcndncmcmmdmdmdmd it&#x27;s so many thing that just have details thatre so unnecessary like a lot of random fanservice ecchi scenes ðŸ˜‘ u just keep going for the overall plot but yea lmao recommending haikyuu is the best thing gunwook could&#x27;ve done lmaooo but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s as big of a watcher like Matthew yet</p>
