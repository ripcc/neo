      <p>I talked with both of them specifically to check one thing and they&#x27;re both a little crazy and negative so I don&#x27;t like talking with them aha but yeah I&#x27;m Ricky biased and had to talk to a lot of rosins for infos both Korean and Chinese and I don&#x27;t bring up this subject with them because it&#x27;s sensitive 😭they&#x27;re more gf stans than ris imo that one crosin was so funny to me though because there was 69000 other confirmations before like girl why are you tweaking out NOW😭</p>
