      <p>Basically a lot worry that if it gets really big it&#x27;ll have big repercussions against kpop in general in China especially since the hallyu ban hasn&#x27;t been completely lifted yet so even the people who don&#x27;t even care about his joke are worried about this and how it could affect kpop as a whole if it explodes To a lot of Chinese people their gouv=their country so they basically see mocking their president as a micro agression esp since they know he probably wouldn&#x27;t have done this about his own president or like, trump or whatever and I see a lot being like do all kpop idols think like this are we all stupid to follow them and give them money etc</p>
