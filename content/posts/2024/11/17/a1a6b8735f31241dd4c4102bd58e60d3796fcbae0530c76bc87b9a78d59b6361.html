      <p>didn&#x27;t want to participate in this discussion because I don&#x27;t care about haobin much but I actually do have a similar story lmao this ssngish krosin akgae I knew that lowkey hated hanbin also told me they were dating she just wasn&#x27;t sure how serious it was and she didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll last, she said she was fine with it as long as Hao is fine with it too
I did know another crosin akgae tho that didn&#x27;t think they were but she also believed the Hao playboy with women rumours ðŸ˜­when she got the confirmation from someone close to Hao that he was definitely gay she crashed out but also accepted it because him potentially messing with his bad mate on the low is way better than him being a gross fuckboy I suddenly remembered talking to these two people because of this, it was funny lol</p>
