      <p>I&#x27;ve been to a few male idols fansigns and sunoo was the rudest male idol I&#x27;ve met imo and I&#x27;ve talked to 2/3 other intl fans who had similar experience he barely acknowledges intl fans and is kinda rude with them but gets all excited and polite with kfans like he does it superr blatantly idk if he treats cfans like this too as there&#x27;s a lot of them I would think he&#x27;d be exposed</p>
