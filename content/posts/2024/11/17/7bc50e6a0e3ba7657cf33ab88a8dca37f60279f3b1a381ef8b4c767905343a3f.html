      <p>my two cents: idrgaf about haobin but this makes no sense brah no amount of tea or being in the right circles would have you know exactly what label they&#x27;re using whether that&#x27;s boyfriends situationship or just friendship like sorry but i honestly think this person is tweaking ðŸ˜­ you can see and hear all the tea you want and then come to your own conclusion but nobody can say for certain that they&#x27;re dating or that they&#x27;re not dating (or that &quot;it&#x27;s not as simple as them dating&quot;) like unless you&#x27;re them or their best friend or something you just wouldn&#x27;t know anything 100%</p>
