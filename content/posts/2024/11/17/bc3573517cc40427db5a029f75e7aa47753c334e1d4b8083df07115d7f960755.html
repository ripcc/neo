      <p>This is just copy pasted Twitter translation they&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s unfair that riize and bnd are nominated for rookie awards and zb1 aren&#x27;t when they&#x27;re all 1 year old rookies  &quot;No, what the fuck, it&#x27;s called the KGMA Rookie of the Year Rise, so I went in and thought, but in the middle of this, Zero Base One was excluded from the nominations. What the fuck, what the heck, if a rookie of the year award wins a grand slam in 23, they&#x27;re excluded from the rookie of the year award in 24?
