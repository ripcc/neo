      <p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if the cbar confirmed with the brand or not, what happened at the end of the day is that the numbers they posted aren&#x27;t matching up with official numbers on taobao which is what really matters and it&#x27;s just not a good look like his taobao sales alone were fine already they should have known other sfs would be waiting to jump them for what they postedðŸ˜­ Ricky really can&#x27;t catch a break with his cbars poor guy also I thought he&#x27;d surpassed yujin for sure but yujin&#x27;s supertopic data has been better than him recently so it feels like they&#x27;re still around the same in cn</p>
