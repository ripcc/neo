      <p>I&#x27;m way more strict but I think it&#x27;s both after that fiasco with that fanned out girl I realized people will do the most to stir up trouble so I was naive for thinking it was in the pursuit of discussion and actual honest opinions plus I don&#x27;t let my inbox fill up I delete anything I&#x27;m not going to answer</p>
