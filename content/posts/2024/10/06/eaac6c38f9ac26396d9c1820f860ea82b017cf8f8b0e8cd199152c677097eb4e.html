      <p>girl, hanbin has mentioned more than once that being a leader gives him a hard time. besides, we know he&#x27;s interested in releasing his own music and going into acting. he&#x27;s not renewing that contract. and we don&#x27;t even know for sure if yuehuaz will be a thing or not, for all we know duhua could make hao go solo to maximize her profits. but if it happens, yunseo and vocal king seungeon will join the group too.</p>
