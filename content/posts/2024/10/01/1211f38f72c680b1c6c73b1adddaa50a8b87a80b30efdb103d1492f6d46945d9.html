      <p>So I’m super tall for a girl (5’10) and I love when men lie about their height and get almost like fact checked when they meet me. Seeing how fragile they are makes me wanna laugh. Like it feels like reparations for sexism. Sometimes I want to go to a meet n greet and see how tall the male idols actually are. Imo Hanbin is more 5’8/5’9, Yujin is 5’7, Jiwoong is 5’7, Taerae and Matthew are like 5’5, Gunwook 6’, Ricky 5’11, Hao 5’10, and Gyuvin 6’1.</p>
