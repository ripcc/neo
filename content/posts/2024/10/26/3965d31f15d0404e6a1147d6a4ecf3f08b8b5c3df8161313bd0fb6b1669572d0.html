      <p>jtbc put like 25 FULL performances in one episode... my head was spinning after i was done with episode one. none of the boys have the full package. there are handsome dudes but most of them suck at singing or dancing ðŸ™„ like who tf am i supposed to root for?? the current number one guy SUCKS at dancing (he looks like yeonjun). people and the mentors have to be blind cause there is one dude who is really handsome and up to korean beauty standards BUT he cant do shit ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and they put him in Level S ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the shows rigged af. there is no other way. everybody is shitting on mnet and their mentors but yall havent seen this shit</p>
