      <p>I don&#x27;t know if Ricky was her pick cause he did trend the most on pann around the time of bp and she ignored a ton of trending hanbin articles too, I Def think she&#x27;s been on sm&#x27;s payroll cause she also ignored quite a few big hate articles on zb1 as well, she did translate the gunwook thing + Hao being outed but she also immediately translated the clarification which I didn&#x27;t expect, I do think she likes Hao the most but not too much generally she seems to veryyyy purposely ignore zb1 and I agree she dislikes yujin/gunwook in particular lol</p>

      <p>i think she knew better to translate the clarification that wouldve been byond fucking nasty but idk what changed she was pretty alright last year shes always been obsessed with sm shes definitely on the payroll its annoying because she really is the biggest bridge for general kpop fans so ignoring zb1 is just not that great it really wasnt that bad last year ugh she needs to smoke herself because zb1 are now 100% left out of the hybe convo and our only monoghost of all people translated and not that well</p>
