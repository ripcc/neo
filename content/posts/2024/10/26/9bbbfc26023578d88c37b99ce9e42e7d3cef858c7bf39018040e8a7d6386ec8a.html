      <p>The opinion of Korean jk akgaes is that the company should have said no because because he had a lot of opportunities some he allegedly wasn&#x27;t aware of for example the Superbowl, the fact that jk has recently been openly antagonistic of the company also gives to his fans the (in that case probably right) impression that he only resigned for BTS, jk and tae seem to be the least satisfied with Hybe and theyre 2/3 of the biggest BTS akgaes fanbases so whether it was his choice or not ultimately doesn&#x27;t matter they&#x27;re disatisfied and it&#x27;s not what THEY wanted</p>
