      <p>the og ask included the tweet I really don&#x27;t wanna keep talking about this cuz it&#x27;s a pointless conversation but just insinuating hao changed degrees to avoid getting kicked out and ragging on his education that fans like to talk about it&#x27;s just akgae rhetoric a stupid assumption and just annoying don&#x27;t worry ab it</p>
