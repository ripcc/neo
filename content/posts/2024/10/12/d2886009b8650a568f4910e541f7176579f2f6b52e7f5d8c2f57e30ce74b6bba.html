      <p>Actually it&#x27;s cause they usually ask one person who they pulled like for example they pulled Ricky and wanted gunwook, they&#x27;ll go to any ricky fan and ask id tgey pulled gunwook and if they wanted to trade. Just had it happen to me today lol https://neospring.org/+r/c3f9e55ffc</p>
