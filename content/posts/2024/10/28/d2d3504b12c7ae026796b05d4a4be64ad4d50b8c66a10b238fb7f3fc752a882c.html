      <p>I was stalking some BTS akgae accounts (it&#x27;s mostly schizo posting and painting their fav as the victim scapegoat and everyone else as evil just like ours so don&#x27;t lose your time stalking lol) but something interesting I&#x27;ve seen is people mentioning that the group contract is until June 2026 which matches with what ktokkis say too, so probably one last cb that I doubt will do well, a tour and then some will leave Hybe
The only question is with all the mess lately how will it work out</p>
