      <p>Literally like for kpop my standards in terms of singers is them being able to deliver their lines live while dancing and newjeans deliver in that aspect, no one is listening to newjeans for insane vocals, they do well with what they have and have good music actually care about their albums as a whole and are now good performers as well they&#x27;re way above the average kpop group idk why people are so overly critical of them compared to everyone else</p>

      <p>yea vocals are obviously no longer a priority and the type of music made does matter so if new jeans can deliver their songs then they got it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
