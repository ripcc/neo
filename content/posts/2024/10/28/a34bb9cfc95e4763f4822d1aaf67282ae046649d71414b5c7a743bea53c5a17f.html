      <p>have u seen svt seungkwan&#x27;s letter????? he posted it a few hours after more of those hybe docs leaked which were talking about joshua&#x27;s dating scandal and how him leaving the group isn&#x27;t the majority opinion but having seungkwan back from his health hiatus would be good since they could distract fans with him and jeonghan interacting with joshua or whatever it was ðŸ˜­ like yesssssss get hybe. also kang daniel commented on it to show support which i feel is significant bc  i remember he sued his old company bc of a bunch of drama (also now that i&#x27;m typing it, didn&#x27;t his old company rebrand into wakeone? or they were related? lmfao)</p>
