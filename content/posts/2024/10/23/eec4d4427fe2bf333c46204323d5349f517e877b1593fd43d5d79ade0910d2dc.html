      <p>diff anon this is his next rumored ba lol crosins are pretty happy bc it&#x27;s a good brand from what ive seen? slightly unrelated but they&#x27;ve been pissed at yuehua for like the past week over the amount of money they have had to spend so far and then new bas dropped with kustie and now this so the fandom consensus for a lot of ppl is to no longer financially stress themselves and mass buy to a million dollars like they did for tt and mistine they&#x27;re just gonna buy based on personal demand and support hao as best as they can obviously but not set these crazy sales goals they HAVE to meet. i meant to send an ask in about this i thought it was interesting but neospring shut down</p>

      <p>it really is worldwide known so yea it&#x27;s good but I&#x27;m actually shocked at how many endorsements have been rolling out it&#x27;s only been like 4 months and he&#x27;s going onto #5 that is nottttt normal like at all ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I&#x27;ve never seen veterans do this much let alone a rookie in a survival group but yea they can&#x27;t keep the records up so good that they decided that maybe even the volume of future endorsements will drop but lolll I was so bored this whole shutdown ðŸ˜­</p>
