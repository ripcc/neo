      <p>I definitely see more Chinese celebrities wearing couture and things like that and there&#x27;s like lots more celebs that have ba titles even if they&#x27;re just announced on weibo and not ig or x, it does feel like fashion is more developed in China but tbh I don&#x27;t know too much</p>
