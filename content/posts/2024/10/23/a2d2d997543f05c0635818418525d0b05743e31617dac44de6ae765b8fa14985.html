      <p>I agree anon disrespecting olay is crazy because thatâ€™s a very well known brand but I do have to say the marketing choice is a bit questionable because why is a 24 year old baby faced idol representing a brand whose main target demographic middle aged women ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ itâ€™s not a bad brand I just wonder if they are genuinely saying yes to any brands atp</p>
