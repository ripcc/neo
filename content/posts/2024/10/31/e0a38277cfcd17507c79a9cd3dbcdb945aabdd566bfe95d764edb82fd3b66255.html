      <p>eh.. tbh this isn&#x27;t even about shipping anymore but anon and yours words were borderline weird towards queer men in particular saur i get why it was hurtful idk it&#x27;s a serious topic so maybe just be more mindful? talking about haobin is one thing but then using a &quot;bc they&#x27;re gay men/queer community&quot; as a reason is crazy also straight people 100% stay friends after dating or fucking even among groups omfg theyre so messy what are u even talking abouthgjdf</p>

      <p>I get it but what did I say about gay men all I said is that I can see the possibility of them staying friends although badly worded I understood anons point and my own experience ðŸ˜­ idk maybe I&#x27;m just not too particular about wording i don&#x27;t place any gravity this isn&#x27;t a serious space or anything and I know what&#x27;s wrong with it but I got the point I do think it&#x27;s easier for queer people to remain friends not that that&#x27;s the actual case for every single person it&#x27;s a personality thing I think the same applies to women I used myself for a reason lol this is what I mean by I&#x27;ll always get mixed in omg fjennfndmdmdm</p>
