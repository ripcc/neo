      <p>Also idk his faith obviously if he&#x27;s in a cult it&#x27;s not the same but in Korea people usually think of Christian as more progressive/left leaning on average than Buddhists like the opposite of the west so him being ok with gay people (and we don&#x27;t know the extent of that) doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean anything</p>

      <p>yea agree you can be either or and religious and either or and nonpracticing/atheist it doesn&#x27;t rlly mean anything but oh that surprising I would&#x27;ve assumed it was the other way around</p>
