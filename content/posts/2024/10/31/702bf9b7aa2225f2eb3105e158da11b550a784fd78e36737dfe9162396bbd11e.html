      <p>Has anyone ever asked him anything about his religion? Unironically the fact that he doesn&#x27;t seem homophobic at all made me doubt whether he&#x27;s super religious lmao</p>

      <p>I don&#x27;t think so honestly nobody in the group pegs me as religious at all and ik hanbins said he&#x27;s agnostic or atheist or smth. Gyuvin doesn&#x27;t come off as deeply religious to me either but him being homophobic or not isn&#x27;t a big marker of that he&#x27;s like maybe a little woker than the average</p>
