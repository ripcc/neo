      <p>The thing is it could be guilt but also gyuvin is weird and has an obsessive personality so this could just be his current thing like remember his whole deer thing at one point</p>

      <p>treaux gyuvin is weird like that but this has been something he&#x27;s brought up for so long and hasn&#x27;t changed on it once he gets obsessed too easily and I think it&#x27;s cuz once he decides something he sticks to it. I still think it&#x27;s a level of guilt because let&#x27;s say he&#x27;s neverrrr drank I don&#x27;t see why he would feel the need to do all this it doesn&#x27;t concern him and it&#x27;s not like he gains points</p>
