      <p>You have to keep in mind that they&#x27;re men I think most people believe they at least had something going on at some point and whether you believe it&#x27;s still going on depends on you but theoretically there being feelings involved and maybe them hooking up or something during bp but then deciding to still be friends and living together and be close to me isn&#x27;t farfetched because they&#x27;re two men they won&#x27;t take this as much to heart yk also their personalities Meanwhile let&#x27;s say gyuvin and his ex gf it would be hard to imagine them continuing to stay close friends and updating each other on the new people they&#x27;re dating etc gyuvin would crash out on pc everyday if that happened gay culture is different</p>
