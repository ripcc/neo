      <p>Gyuvin at church
Pastor: If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
Romans 10:9
Gyuvin: ah preacher man this is really, really such a touching sentence and it reminded me of something sung hanbitna told me the other day..he told me &quot;aigo gyubinie drink carefully&quot; and it made me think that if I had drank alcohol and gotten alcohol poisoning, hanbin would have saved me, because i believed it with all my heart I started crying, hanbin Hyung gave me a pat on the back and somehow it brought me back to boys planet..I called ricky to tell him this story and also that I want to get married to him</p>
