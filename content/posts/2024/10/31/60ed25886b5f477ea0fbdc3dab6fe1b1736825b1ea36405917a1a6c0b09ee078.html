      <p>AS A WINX CLUB ENTHUSIAST that was my first thought too Lara may be darker but manon looks more like her they were trying to fit personalities so I can agree Lara fits aisha better. I think flora could&#x27;ve been yoonchae also but this lineup was pretty perfect so I&#x27;m happy with it</p>
