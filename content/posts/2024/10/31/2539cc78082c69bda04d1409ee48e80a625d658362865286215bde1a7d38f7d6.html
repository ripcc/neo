      <p>you know what, even though there is little chance he is going to be part of it, but i really, really don&#x27;t want hanbin to be part of that mama collab stage. not only because of hybe groups but also because K-band fans are already ready with their pitchforks. they are seriously angry that mnet is making idols performing a band stage instead of inviting an actual band group, and they are right. mnet really should invite day6 instead of this not needed collab
also rosins and some so called ot9s are already declaring they are not going to watch this stage</p>
