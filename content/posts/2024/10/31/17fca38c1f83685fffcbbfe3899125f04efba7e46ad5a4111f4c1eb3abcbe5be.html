      <p>oooo yea i agree and I think thats y hes pretty easy to talk at first cause hes prob used to people coming in and out of his life so he tries to make it as friendly as possible in that short time like when u watch content where hes with new ppl its pretty natural and flows smoothly like he aint shy but when they try to get to know him more like go from acquaintance to friends i think thats when he closes off and where the introvert takes over but it makes sense y</p>

      <p>wow i agreeeeeeee like he seems easy to chat but i guess the reason he comes off as an anomaly sometimes is because of the more constant surface level relationships i wonder if he cherishes deeper friendships more than most ppl then its probably why he and gyuvin work</p>
