      <p>i&#x27;m the anon from like a week ago who was annoyed at the lack of live singing and i&#x27;m watching this new zepisode, why do so many of the clips of them performing sound live as fuck 😭😭😭😭😭😭 not a single person&#x27;s video at the shows sounded like this but u can hear adlibs they&#x27;ve added and actual live vocals like i&#x27;m confused did they somehow increase the volume of their live vocals for the zepisode or was no one recording when they were singing live or what</p>

      <p>I went back to watch some concert clips after that ask and highkey they sounded live in a lot of bits idk if they&#x27;re switching consistently through the concert and or just lowering mics but let me go watch the zepisode to see what u talking about but it would be stupid if they only did it for the zepisodes like 🤦‍♀️</p>
