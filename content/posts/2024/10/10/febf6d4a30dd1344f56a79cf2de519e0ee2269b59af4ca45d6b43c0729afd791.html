      <p>https://neospring.org/+r/a8414c85d2 Different anon but if wakeone plan the same thing for 2025 like this year, we probably going to get the 2nd world tour until dec. And they will wrap up things around that time as well which means the disbandment on 10th jan or late jan are both possible. But the way yuehua act, I do think they want to snatch their artists quickly following the og contract</p>

      <p>whatever future tours they do are going to be separate they&#x27;re going to have disbandment concerts like every other survival show group and it never ends on the predicted date it&#x27;s not 1/10 I promise</p>
