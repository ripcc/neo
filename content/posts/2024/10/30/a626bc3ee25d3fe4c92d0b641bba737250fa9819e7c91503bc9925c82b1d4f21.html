      <p>These vids made me realize how delulu fans are and they gen believe it 😭 (I would too ngl 😭😭😭😭😭😭) Have you guys seen the perspective on stage? If you&#x27;re pit from the idol&#x27;s perspective you only see from their eyebrows and above and usually they have their phones in front of their faces with signs so they&#x27;re probably reading something and from that distance they&#x27;re usually looking at a group of 20 ppl but because of perspective it looks like they&#x27;re looking at you 😭 I just crack tf up when I see vids like this it&#x27;s just so funny 😭😭😭😭😭 But again I too would be delulu af like yas tartar wants me bad 😍</p>

      <p>? No there&#x27;s a large distance between pits and stages to avoid that if the members can recognize their favorite fansites from pits I think they can see pretty clearly but yea it&#x27;s easy to give a personal perspective to a group of people that&#x27;s why people always get confused on who got special interactions and who didn&#x27;t like those rosins and hao. BUT EXACTLY I WOULD TURN DEMONIC IF I GOT THAT😂😂😂✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️ they were def looking at that girl tho u can tell with how frequent her interactions were and constant eye contact breaking</p>
