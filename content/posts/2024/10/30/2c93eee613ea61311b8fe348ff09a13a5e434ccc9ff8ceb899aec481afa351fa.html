      <p>oh op here I donâ€™t think most asian countries have these but it is an outlet store basically meaning that they sell known brands (and some more niche) e.g calvin Klein, hilfiger, etc. on discounted prices. occasionally you may even find luxury brands like Chanel, Gucci but these are always second hand (except maybe their accessories like sunglasses) and they sell almost anything, cosmetics, home stuff, clothes, shoes etc</p>
