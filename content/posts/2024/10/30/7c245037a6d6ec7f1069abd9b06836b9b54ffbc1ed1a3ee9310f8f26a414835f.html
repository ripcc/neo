      <p>anon&#x27;s source: twitter users saying the postype top ships of 2023 list is exclusive hybe report content when hybe only mentioned svt, txt and nct ships i&#x27;m p sure ðŸ˜­ it was hanbin at a fansign, when asked when they&#x27;d do a mukbang together, that said they were gonna do a mukbang in bangkok but couldn&#x27;t for some reason, people found that pretty ?? bc 2binz did said mukbang live in bangkok when haobin were the ones who were roommates in the first place so idk, somehow they got to do a live in the end i imagine bc ppl just found the whole thing strange and that was talked about a lot, still odd they even allowed a haobin live tho. changing the narrative to make it look like the tweet being viral is only bc of hao instead of just accepting reality and not having a panic attack over hao interacting with his fellow member who he actually doesn&#x27;t hate (or vice versa) and ppl enjoying it bc they&#x27;re not social outcasts is sooooo.. like wow sorry for the rant but these people are crazy like anon even acknowledges how coked up they sound and yet they still don&#x27;t wanna go to rehab lmao</p>
