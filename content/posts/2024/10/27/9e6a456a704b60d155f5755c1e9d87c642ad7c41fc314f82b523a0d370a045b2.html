      <p>Aespa are so boring to watch and they rarely ever sing live, nj rlly stepped up on their lives this year plus they are always fun to watch on stage. Like compare any aespa end of year perf to a nj one. Nobody slacks in NJ but we got Giselle trying to still recover from her two left feet, the other girls just pick and choose when they want to be interesting</p>
