      <p>I don&#x27;t think HYBE kick-started the bullying scandals bc everything started bc some twins from the national volleyball team got involved in a big scandal for being bullies, thanks to this people started exposing idols and actors, and that&#x27;s how Soojin got exposed. But idk if anything the one that was on her way to become the biggest one in the group has always been Miyeon, I actually think that if she was a better dancer and cube released a more cunty and fun song for her solo, she would&#x27;ve had a sk hit on her hands, but sadly she released a very boring album.</p>
