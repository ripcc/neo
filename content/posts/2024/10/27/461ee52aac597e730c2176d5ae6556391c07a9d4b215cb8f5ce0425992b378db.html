      <p>Taehyung has said in the past he only renewed because of the group implying he is disatisfied with the company or the contract and has shown some disdain towards Hybe in recent times, before he said this there were rumours about these two being the hardest to convince and having the highest requirements which matches that taehyung statement and hybe staff calling Jungkook complicated/hard to handle, given that jk was allegedly kept in the dark about the Superbowl and openly supported newjeans and taehyungs album had so much issues regarding promos I can&#x27;t imagine them staying for the sake of the team anymore when Hybe is crumbling down</p>
