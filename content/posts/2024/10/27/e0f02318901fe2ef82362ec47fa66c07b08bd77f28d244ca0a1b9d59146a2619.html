      <p>It&#x27;s true though giselle and karina are actually interchangeble as vocalists her support and technique is solid and always has been (she used to be in choir) whereas minji is underdeveloped as kazuha the only reason she or any of the other nwjns members doesn&#x27;t get any slack is because their songs don&#x27;t require any actual singing it&#x27;s all just soft whispery vibes and they have nice tones that&#x27;s pretty much it although hanni and danielle have some decent support going on</p>
