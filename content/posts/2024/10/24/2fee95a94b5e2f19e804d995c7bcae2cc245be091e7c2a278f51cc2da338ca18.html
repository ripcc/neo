      <p>Can&#x27;t believe people want him to go back to blonde rn he&#x27;s definitely one of the top visual of this generation like he looks perfect rn they found a makeup that fits his intense features well while not overdoing it (flashbacks to his eyebrows during yura yura era) and the black fits him because it contrasts his face well and also I agree I prefer him with bangs especially wavy bangs like this it shortens his face</p>
