      <p>they&#x27;re aware yuehua isn&#x27;t great but they know duhua likes her money makers. her relationship with them isn&#x27;t perfect by any means (it takes her a long ass time to sue yibo antis and she often uses his clout to promote her personal activities and other smaller yh artists) but she gives them resources and makes the effort to build a brand identity for them, so they expected that treatment for zh too considering they had proved themselves with their buying power and duhua had acknowledged it by bragging about zh&#x27;s sales. anyway, they&#x27;re mad and want duhua to give him more resources in china and korea. and not to sound like I&#x27;m defending yh (they&#x27;re trash) but they&#x27;re actually trying to build zh&#x27;s personal branding in china by being more selective of the brands he endorses and the magazines he collabs with, it&#x27;s a work in progress but you can tell they&#x27;re trying. some of mistine&#x27;s BAs were/are zhao lusi, cai xukun and wu lei. tangle teezer&#x27;s was gong jun. kustie&#x27;s was xu kai. and olay&#x27;s were/are bailu, xiao zhan, yang zi, among others. they&#x27;re trying to do something but crosins want zh to have more schedules that give him gp exposure.
btw, anon, crosins don&#x27;t give a fuck about the artists from yh kr and they&#x27;re convinced zh is going to be a soloist anyway so they don&#x27;t care that much about what happened to uniq, everglow, tempest, etc.</p>

(idk if u mean chinese or korean) gp exposure while hes active in zb1 hed have to choose one or the other and i think its stupid to fail to consider hao being in yuehua kr cuz its likely and hes already signed there no? my point still stands tho theyre living in a dream and duhua isnt even waiting on hao since shes working on ollie</p>
