      <p>It&#x27;s Bruno Mars. The guy was given 3 songs to choose from and picked Apt since it sounds fun. Luckily, the song has Korean touch which made it easier for the gp to love it. For ifans, it&#x27;s curiosity because it&#x27;s Bruno &amp; finding out that the song was actually fun. Jennie&#x27;s Mantra was supposed to be big, let&#x27;s be honest. It&#x27;s the Karina blocking her and then Rosé coming from nowhere that ruined her flower. Now, Jennie&#x27;s company is struggling and lost. Everyone is so focused on Apt now. Like, promoting Mantra won&#x27;t do aynthing. Might as well give up and try again next time. Such a missed opportunity though.</p>
