      <p>he used to have a decent balance around when they first debuted but i think he must find it hard to be active on all platforms especially when they get busy and packed with schedules... like understandably they were busy during debut but they were only focusing on one app which was twitter. now they have more platforms/things they need be active on like instagram, mnet plus chat, doing lives, tiktok (which is becoming a more consistent used app for them) and he probs just can&#x27;t keep up with it all and he&#x27;s not much of a talker too and he&#x27;s a big perfectionist so hes not just gonna upload anything like the others and if anything they&#x27;re only getting busier so finding the balance must be hard for him still and as he said he values his personal time and does what he wants so that&#x27;s another factor but tbh i hope he finds it soon like he just needs to choose like 1 or 2 of the platforms to be decently active on cause one we all miss him and two riyangis can finally put that sns ban shit to rest</p>
