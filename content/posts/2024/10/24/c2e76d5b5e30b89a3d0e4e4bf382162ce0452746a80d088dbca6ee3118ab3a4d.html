      <p>the way ricky suddenly goes very active (like the posts on instagram and messaging on plus chat yesterday and the livestream today) and then is dead silent for weeks up to like a month on end confuses me so bad like it&#x27;s so weird ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and it&#x27;s such a drama every time like i wanna know if this is something he thinks about a lot, like does he see zeroses/riyangis constantly petition for wakeone to let him post and what are his thoughts on that, or if he just dgaf and happens to have moments where he wants to/feels like he should be very active as well as how involved the company is in all this online activity stuff. i know he&#x27;s said in an interview that he&#x27;s very sure of himself and has an idgaf attitude but idk man. his online presence just has me perplexed and he feels so mysterious to me since every other member (minus like... jiwoong) posts places pretty regularly with none of these odd vibes lmao</p>
