      <p>oh zamn are you fluent in Japanese? I mean considering Matthew&#x27;s part of the top 3 and has been so for like the entirety of zb1 what would you think about him being pushed ðŸ¤” I can&#x27;t really imagine him not being at the top plus I want mattwook to reign supreme somewhere but yea I&#x27;m surprised Ricky&#x27;s gap moes only catching on now it suits jfans tastes a lot</p>
