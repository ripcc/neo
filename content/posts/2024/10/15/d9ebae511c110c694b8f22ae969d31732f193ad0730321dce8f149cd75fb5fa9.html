      <p>This is also just another assumption but when he got his chin implant done he was younger and at a healthier weight so he had natural face fat to blend his chin implant into his face but we all know he&#x27;s extremely underweight now (like most idols) and probably naturally losing baby fat from aging as well which is why he needs jaw and even cheek filler unlike 1 year ago etc. so that his chin implant isn&#x27;t as obvious.</p>
