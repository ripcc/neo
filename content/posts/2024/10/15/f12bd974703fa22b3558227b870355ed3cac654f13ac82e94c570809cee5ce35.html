      <p>They have much better pr still tho despite also having a lot of similar accusations and accidents as Hybe, like I&#x27;m shocked at how many people sided with sm over cbx, although I guess exos rÃ©putation was already very bad compared to newjeans</p>

      <p>I didn&#x27;t fully get into the situation but from what I read I wasn&#x27;t on cbxs side tbh or felt sympathy like new jeans because it seemed like rash decisions that backfired on them like that&#x27;s their problem ðŸ˜­ not to mean that I was on sms side either they can leave they weren&#x27;t smart ab it</p>
