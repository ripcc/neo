      <p>i dont understand what hybe&#x27;s plan is with katseye. they&#x27;ve been doing well on spotify and tiktok but nobody rlly recognizes them outside the kpop stan sphere. and they r supposed to be a global group. how is the yeonjun feature, mama performance, and music show promotions going to help them be recognized as that? and there&#x27;s a very small chance that they will gain a considerable korean audience, so it seems like theyre going to limited w the audience of western kpop stans. but at the end of the day they are doing better than vcha lol i hope sm&#x27;s global bg flops</p>

      <p>I know they&#x27;re also supposed to be a geffen? gg so where&#x27;s that side of promo they haven&#x27;t tried even a little outside the kpop sphere like I understand because they&#x27;re hybe affiliated the kpop aspect is gonna stick but the yeonjun feature was theeeee dumbest move ever and was obviously for his benefit ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ik they&#x27;re gonna be performing at the moa soon but like.. only kpop fans will show up this is supposed to be 5H 2.0 they need to try harder but yea same that british bg looks a hot doodoo mess</p>
