      <p>anon must be new because we talked about ALL the members going in depth multiple times, digging from their baby pics until now analyzing every angle and even debunking ps because we realize so and so never got so and so done. I know we a gossip cc but we base our gossip on facts and this is why I hate hao chin talk because these stupid anons show up and think we only ever talk about hao&#x27;s chin but maybe it&#x27;s because his face is the most inconsistent and we notice it so how is that our fault? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
