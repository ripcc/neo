      <p>mmmmm I mean I kinda considered that in my list to begin with like hanbin and jiwoong I see why people like them they&#x27;re good looking they&#x27;re just not attractive to me but yes for Matthew he&#x27;s really attractive to me the only reason I put hanbin above is because this was about their &quot;best day&quot; so when hanbin was the most attractive to me I quite liked it not anymore tho</p>
