      <p>idk if any other anons know this but i remember ppl would complain about the colour of your page&#x27;s theme - maybe it&#x27;s not so bad now tho - and i just found out there&#x27;s an option in settings so that all profiles have the same default theme (found this when i saw some other page with the most eye soring theme of all time and was desperate lmao) so if y&#x27;all want you can go to settings and select &quot;no&quot; under the &quot;allow profile themes&quot; thing</p>
