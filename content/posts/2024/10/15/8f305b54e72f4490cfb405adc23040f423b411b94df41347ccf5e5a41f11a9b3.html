      <p>seeing several fandoms celebrate tweets of their favs getting 20k likes and calling it viral makes me realise how zb1 are very popular because that happens to us like every day almost like yes they fell off bad since BP but they&#x27;ve maintained steady attention from randoms and a steady core fandom more or less</p>

      <p>exactly zb1 might&#x27;ve had a fall but they&#x27;re no peasants WERE STILL DUKE STATUSSSSSSSS they have the most important thing for a boy group and they still beat out their competitors (plave is not valid don&#x27;t care) that&#x27;s why they&#x27;ll never totally fail ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
