      <p>this is just my opinion but i think many of the reasons why eunseok is unscathed even in the riize fandom (Anton still has muchhhhhhhh more haters inside the fandom) is because a lot of the proofs were just he said she said.. like we just got screenshots of random conversations and there is no solidifying evidence proving that eunseok was messaging these girls whereas jiwoong and anton have full on video/picture evidence of what they have done like fjhbjdfbjsdifhf ofc he is untouched</p>
