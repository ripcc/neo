      <p>This is taking me out. Comparing to the amount of shit other members got on the now dead cc, Ricky&#x27;s convo is nothing. Like super harmless. Queef&#x27;s cc became popular because of how her cc treated Hanbin. Rosins were snipping the cc because of how we talk about Hao. Gyuvin too. Nevermind uncle. He deserves it. ðŸ˜‚</p>
