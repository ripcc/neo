      <p>lmfao briize saying that riize are the most impactful 5th gen group like zb1 didn‚Äôt kickstart this gen with their sound and concept. zb1 were the ones that brought back easy-listening and bright concepts with their debut and pretty much is the reason why there was a mini bg renaissance last year and early this year dpmo these groups are lucky zb1 is a non-big 4 group with no resources, mediaplay or payola or else they would‚Äôve been much bigger. Ugghhh i know when zb1 disbands people are going to be crying at how they were a great group like nobody is appreciating them now but i see them being appreciated in the future üôÅ i just hate the disrespect the boys get when they have been impactful with their sound, identity and concepts</p>
