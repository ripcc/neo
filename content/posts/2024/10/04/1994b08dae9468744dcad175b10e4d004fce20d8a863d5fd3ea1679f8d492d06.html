      <p>How do people lie so confidently like this. This does not even scape last year at all. Matthew new variety show (possibly 2 baby cloud), Gyuvin baby cloud, Ricky brand ambassador, Hao Madame fiagaro, Hanbin AAA, Taerae new ost, concerts, zbtving back, plus chat like you clearly werenâ€™t actually here during September last year or your still in an akgae bubble tryna convince yourself no oneâ€™s getting shit so you can mentally feel like your in September last year ðŸ˜­</p>
