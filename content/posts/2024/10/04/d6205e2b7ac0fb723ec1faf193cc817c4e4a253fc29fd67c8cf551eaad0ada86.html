      <p>Isn&#x27;t sunghoon endorsing some japanese skincare brand, and is now the L&#x27;Oreal and Tiffany embassador? Plus gentle monster and that other perfume brand that Jennie also endorses has him on a bunch of events that they do? Imo he&#x27;s getting more right now, and afaik there&#x27;s some rumors about him and Calvin Klein bc the director in korea keeps liking his post&#x27;s</p>
