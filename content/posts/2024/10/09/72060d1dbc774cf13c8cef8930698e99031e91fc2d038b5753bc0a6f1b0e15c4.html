      <p>I actually remember him talking about how they worked with a lot of different departments so like he said something about how he was able to find which camera was on quickly because at uni they worked with the camera and production department and obviously they had writing assessments and producing classes and singing and dancing. I remember he did a bit of acting too because during bp (cmiiw) he talked about doing screen test during uni. I think itâ€™s just called kpop but it seems very thorough on industry workings rather than the training a kpop idol does. He said on his lmj he was actually accepted into two other universities but for different majors I imagine he went with this because the curriculum covered a lot more things that would benefit him.</p>
