      <p>yea i agree personally i think he looks good with both thin or thick like that&#x27;s not a problem to me what does irk me is how they love to snatch the natural arch of his brows like they always end up so straight and they&#x27;re shaped upward and idk that just always bothered me like pls stop playing in his face they were looking so good around late june to early sept but they reverted them right back to that hideous shape again like ughhhhhhh</p>
