      <p>but the drama doesn&#x27;t end there, some cris were so mad at kato for setting a high goal in such a short time that they dmed and tagged kato in posts asking them to extend the deadline and some weren&#x27;t too kind with their words which made other cris freak out because those bad apples basically ruined their fandom&#x27;s reputation. poor cris who did nothing wrong were having a meltdown, they think brands will see them as an ungrateful and grumpy fandom with no buying power now.</p>

      <p>ouuuuu.. ur joking there&#x27;s no way they just publicly ruined their own image but it&#x27;s understandable Ricky JUST had another endorsement the timing and goal of it all is rather unfair and would be hard for any fandom</p>
