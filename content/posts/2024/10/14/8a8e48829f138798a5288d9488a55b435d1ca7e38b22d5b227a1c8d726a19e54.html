      <p>If u guys saw his zhihu acc that was exposed a few months ago there&#x27;s no denying he got a chin implant because those pics of him were from 2018? 2019 so he was 18 which means his jaw&#x27;s already done developing and if there were natural changes it wont be as drastic like growing an entire new chin (most drastic jaw/ chin changes happens between 13-16 in boys). This is just my assumptions he probably got his chin implant when he got into yuehua china? Dunno but the chin implant was horrendous and unnaturally pointy that in June-ish he prob got jaw fillers around the chin implant to make that area fuller, blend the obvious implant line so that the chin implant isn&#x27;t so obvious now that there&#x27;s volume on the side. And it&#x27;s probably why his face looks extra weird when he&#x27;s bloated because filler is hydrophilic.</p>

      <p>LMAOOO that account was a time lol but yup seeing the photos there you could really see the difference. and same i think he got the implant way before bp but the filler experimenting was needed imo cuz that implant was twerking in the air in the winter but ouuu i didnt even consider the filler might be fighting back on a bad day ðŸ˜­</p>
