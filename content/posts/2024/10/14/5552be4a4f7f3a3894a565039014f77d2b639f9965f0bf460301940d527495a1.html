      <p>i dont know if they are on the works with him but he was definitely on gucci china&#x27;s radar for long now. they bidded to be on his l&#x27;officiel cover, he was invited to the gucci shanghai opening, and for madame figaro gucci is the only one who is not haute couture but they dedicated a whole cover for zhang hao to wear it even if it was out of theme</p>

      <p>I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a difference with branches and if he would have a relationship with Gucci china specifically but that&#x27;s interesting so would he still get sponsored clothing like other brands for appearances</p>
