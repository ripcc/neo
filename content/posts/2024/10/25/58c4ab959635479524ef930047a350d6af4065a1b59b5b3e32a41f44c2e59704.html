      <p>I&#x27;m surprised that xhs vid didn&#x27;t make it to kzeroses ðŸ˜­ I know Gunwooks noona fans gonna tweak tf out ðŸ˜­ It wasn&#x27;t bad though but just the way she was sitting on that cart and laughing just gives a bad taste especially when you know fans are videoing you, I guess it&#x27;s more of lack of professionalism which is the main argument fans have against her</p>

      <p>They would&#x27;ve got soooo upset at her but yea it&#x27;s more lack of professionalism and her likeness to annoying fans im pretty sure some kgpds were aware of the video they&#x27;re just smart enough to not repost it and get gunwook in trouble</p>
