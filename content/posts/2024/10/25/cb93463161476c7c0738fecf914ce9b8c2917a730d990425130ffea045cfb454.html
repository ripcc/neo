      <p>I can readily tell Hao, Hanbin, and Ricky are Pannchoa admin picks for BP, most likely because they are Chinese. She obviously didn&#x27;t want Yujin and Gunwook in ZB1. LOL, when there was a horrible encore from ZB1, she purposefully chose the 21st remark to shade Yujin above other top comments concerning Ricky&#x27;s vocal break, and everyone knows she always translates negative articles about Gunwook.
