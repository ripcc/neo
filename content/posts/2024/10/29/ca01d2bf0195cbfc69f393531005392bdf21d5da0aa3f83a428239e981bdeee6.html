      <p>You&#x27;re right it is strategy and 100% other companies have similar reports but hybes go completely out of the norm with their obsession and incel level remarks ofc reports benefitting your own is to be expected but they detailed THEIR EVIL SABOTAGE AS WELL ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and the fact that they said such crazy things about most of the industry attacked their former trainees even went as far as labeling female idols feminists which could put them in actual danger was just the light stuff.. hybe definitely got dirtier and nasty it&#x27;s also just worse since it&#x27;s becoming publicized nobody shocked at an average big company tactic but this wasn&#x27;t normal and there&#x27;s 17,980 more pages thatre worse than what we&#x27;ve seen</p>
