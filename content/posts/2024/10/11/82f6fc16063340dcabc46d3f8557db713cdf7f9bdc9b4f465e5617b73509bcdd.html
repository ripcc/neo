      <p>seems like taerae&#x27;s cbar closed because of internal fighting between admins? from what I saw one admin just closed the account and right before another one was still preparing things and was active so they&#x27;re calling the first admin immature and demand them to give the account to other admins, from what I&#x27;ve seen in the comments of a bigger post, the closing has nothing to do with taerae and his fans</p>
