      <p>Same anon I did some more snooping, the admin just kicked everyone else out of the account including a new admin who&#x27;d been uploading clips, posted saying the account would stop posting as of today and then turned comments off ðŸ˜­ I don&#x27;t think anything happened but it&#x27;s kind of nasty to not hand over the account when there are other people willing to be admin like cbar is important for cfans</p>

      <p>unless the admin is psychotic there&#x27;s definitely a reason it could be personal or external but nerfing a cbar without consulting anyone AND not letting people join is crazy work like this is maaaaajorly important and esp during the tour when cbars are the ones who usually organize ads at every stop</p>
