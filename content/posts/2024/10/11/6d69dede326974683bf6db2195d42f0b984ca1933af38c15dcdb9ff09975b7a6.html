      <p>Iâ€™m sorry but some ppl need to get fr animal life does not hold up to human life and itâ€™s really crazy that people are seriously deciding to stay in their home with their dogs during this hurricane instead of leaving and protecting themselves because at that point youâ€™re basically  just asking for it- nvm lemme chill but idk itâ€™s just stupid same with like homeless people no way ppl are making shelters for animals during this hurricane before shelter for them</p>

      <p>Seeing the weak aftermath of the hurricane is kinda jarring but truly all the warning signs felt so scary I don&#x27;t get how people stayed through all that and if it&#x27;s really that serious why can&#x27;t these people just bring their pets like idgi ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I&#x27;m a pet owner as well like I&#x27;d just grab my cat and all her things but these people better thank god it wasn&#x27;t as catastrophic as it was being predicted to be</p>
