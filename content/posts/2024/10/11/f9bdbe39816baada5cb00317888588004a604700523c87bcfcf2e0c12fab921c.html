      <p>I&#x27;m so happy seunghan is back cuz now they have their own jiwoong and we can use that as a drag for whenever the next briize vs zerose fanwar happens, now we only need a tws scandal from the only two popular members they have and ZB1 will be the next WANNA ONE as it was always mean to be, better late than ever</p>
