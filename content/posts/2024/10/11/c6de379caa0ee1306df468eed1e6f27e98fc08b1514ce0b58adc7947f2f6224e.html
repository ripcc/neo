      <p>i theorise that they had an article about how he was leaving ready to post since it seemed inevitable considering he was on hiatus for nearly a whole year so when they got notified by sm that he was actually coming back (assuming it works like that and they were like assigned by sm to break the news in an exclusive report) they just posted the article about him leaving like it was second nature bc that&#x27;s what was expected the whole time. the bit about the members agreeing that he would leave trips me up a bit tho, maybe they had discussions and were like fine with him leaving if he wanted to?</p>

      <p>Seunghan is definitely fucking someone there were so many telltale signs of his departure and I don&#x27;t believe the bs of the members being there for him ðŸ˜­ the choice seems abrupt but it&#x27;s in line with the choice of entering a more global push but I also think it was to jumpstart the reaction to his return it wasn&#x27;t even a full 30 minutes in between</p>
