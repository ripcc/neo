I dont even know where all that stuff he puts under his skin goes to. I really hope his face wont end up like Renjuns</p>

      <p>ah i saw ur ask on moons page and mmm it does look different and heavier but i think whatever filler was making him look mad puffy a few months back around his mouth and cheek area is gone? cuz now you can see the implant a lot more but theres more at the tip of his chin theyre trynna make his face look more masculine i think which i dont rlly like but he wont end up like renjun he had A LOT plus he had a naturally round face</p>
