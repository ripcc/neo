      <p>I actually don’t think it’s that crazy to assume he’s attending or at least invited. There’s no schedule that day, they will deffo be in kr since they have loads of fansigns that week. And they exact caption was on the video of his Swarovski shoot and they said see you in seongsu Dong on October 17th the day of the event but I think they spoiled it because they edited it and took it out of the caption. They only have one domestic brand ambassador (chaewon) and he’s practically plastered all over their kr site and even their kakao gift site so I really think there’s a good chance of him going.</p>
