      <p>this doesn&#x27;t only apply to riyangis it can apply to other zb1 subfandoms and even just kpop fandoms in general but someone needs to tell these ppl that blaming the company for every thing rather than looking into what is the cause of the actual issue makes it harder to address and solve said issue bc ur not even going the right way about it ðŸ˜­ like they&#x27;ll be like &quot;yeah idc i just hate [company] so i&#x27;m gonna blame [company]&quot; but that&#x27;s not productive at all? and the way some ppl go about it too seems so clout fiendish which then makes it look like they don&#x27;t even care about mistreatment and the, at best, unintentional neglect and, at worst, abuse these idols go through idkkkkkkk like the amount of random tweets i&#x27;ll see with &quot;and fuck wakeone&quot; when it&#x27;s hardly even relevant to the situation or it could even be something that&#x27;s otherwise lighthearted yet they&#x27;re still finding a way to be negative and then boom 5k likes ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Thank you for putting it into words this is one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to kpop fans and specifically zeroses like the way these people can slip a &quot;fuck [company]&quot; INTO ANYTHINGGGGG OMG JUST SHUT UP ðŸ˜­ it&#x27;s not even relevant most of the times and it&#x27;s just such an overused statement it only gets more and more annoying</p>
