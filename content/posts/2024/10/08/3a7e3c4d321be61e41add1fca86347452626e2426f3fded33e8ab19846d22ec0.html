      <p>Anon this isn&#x27;t shocking not only do you get to see their start it&#x27;s also fun to see their growth from now. Literally ask any survival show group fandom what contents to watch, it could be Enhypen or twice, and they would say the survival show too</p>

It&#x27;s such a huge part of their identity and it&#x27;s one of the things that separates them from other groups not to mention finale day has yet to be topped as top 5 happiest days in the world</p>
