      <p>How I wish Gunwook can pursue his studies like what Hao did. But the problem is that, he really likes being an idol and he didn&#x27;t establish other career paths growing up aside from idol life. He has nothing to go back to so he needs to succeed. Unless he leaves idol life at 23, goes to the military then goes to college after and be a normal citizen, wasting his talent.</p>
