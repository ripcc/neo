      <p>Itâ€™s a technical collage but he has a degree and graduated all the same and he it was a 3 year course. Idk if itâ€™s the same in Korea and my country but itâ€™s the same level if you will but the focus of a technical school is more on specific job training and degrees in specific fields which is what some people prefer and is becoming a more popular option (at least where Iâ€™m from)</p>
