      <p>O that was the outdoor fansigning and this reminds me cause most of the time they&#x27;re looking in the general direction but because the cam is so zoomed in it looks like they&#x27;re specifically looking at you and that&#x27;s what feeds the deluluness ðŸ˜­ there was a recent hao fancam and some kzeroses was tweaking cause it look like hao pointed to her specifically when he sang always but there were 10 other xhs girlies saying he was looking at them ðŸ’€ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
