      <p>afaik he didnâ€™t do it at home which is one of the reasons he dropped out, he was on campus but he was taking online classes there and he said he felt really lonely without anyone there plus during covid so it was one reason why he dropped out. he also mentioned how he got the botched shoulder tattoo there while his sister got hers in vancouver</p>
