      <p>I mean apart from the maknae line who just finished school or haven’t yet and they can’t really attend college freely (so we don’t know if they can attend a good Uni etc) the group has had at least two (maybe even three?) members that did at the very least start uni in good universities with good majors so that makes it seem less likely that they are just air in the head and for gunwook who obviously can’t attend a normal uni it is obvious that he is smart</p>
