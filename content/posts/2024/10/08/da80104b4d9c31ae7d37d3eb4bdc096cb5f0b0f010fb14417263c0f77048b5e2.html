      <p>Iâ€™m crying because I just saw a video of gyuvin hugging takuto and like the way Gyuvin kept looking back down at him he has so much loveeeee in him and like idc my critiques still stand about his immaturity but like I really do think Gyuvin is special and I love that he loves so much and seeing that much care and adoration is rare already but especially in a man idk but im crying and like tears are coming out I hope he always loves and he always shows affection for people ðŸ˜­ heâ€™s not even top 5 jebewon members for me and I used to actively dislike him but heâ€™s sooooo special idk</p>
