      <p>good for Ricky but we don&#x27;t need Japan gp support tho their core fandom is already strong there they can chart easily. Instead we need the kr gp support which we&#x27;ll never get for some reasons 😞</p>

      <p>well I mean if you can get one try everything else there&#x27;s no issue 🤷‍♀️ but gp support isn&#x27;t everything most successful groups don&#x27;t even have that because it&#x27;s the general kpop sphere in Korea that people mistake it for only a couple of the top groups really reach the actual Korean gp</p>
