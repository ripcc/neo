      <p>https://x.com/KATOKATOMAKEUP/status/1846481211511710088 kato kato gave riyangis an sns engagement challenge but I can&#x27;t be the only one who thinks it&#x27;s bad for riyangis to engagement farm by trying to summon bots? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the comments are full of people asking for a sugar daddy, saying they were hacked and need help with their homework. wouldn&#x27;t doing all that give them a bad image? idk but I would be weirded out if I was the brand and saw them spamming the comments with shit like that.</p>
