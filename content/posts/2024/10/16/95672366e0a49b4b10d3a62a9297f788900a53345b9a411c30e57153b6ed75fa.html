      <p>yea but like.. that&#x27;s very bare minimum and that&#x27;s the one and only thing they&#x27;ve done for him it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t think mnh doesn&#x27;t want him but what&#x27;re they gonna do with him?? That 8turn sticker thing was noise marketing there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;re adding him there and I doubt they&#x27;d make a group around him by himself</p>
