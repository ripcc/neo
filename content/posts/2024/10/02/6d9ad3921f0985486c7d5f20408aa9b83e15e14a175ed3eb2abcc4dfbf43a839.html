      <p>the thing is ricky was not a fan boy like that tho he wasnt getting that deep in where he was observing fan idol relationships like look who his fav was its gd hes kinda an icon outside of kpop and i feel like its different when ur into kpop with the intention of joining that world rather than just being a fan</p>
