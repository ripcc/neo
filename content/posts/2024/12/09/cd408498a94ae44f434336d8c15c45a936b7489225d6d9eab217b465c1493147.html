      <p>Wakeone actually pmo so bad like itâ€™s no coincident that after Gunwook sent support for the people protesting suddenly all the boys are MIA on pc. This aggravates me so bad like idols are being praised for speaking up and supporting the protesters but this company is more worried about what incels online will say when they never supported zb1 in the first place ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬</p>

      <p>Right im genuinely wondering who this soft ban is for? Like it can&#x27;t be the fans surely it can&#x27;t they&#x27;re the very people protesting and bringing attention to zbwon via support lightings and merch LIKE UGH CAN THEY JUST GO FUCKING SMOKE THEMSELVES THOSE FAT INCELS ARE NOT AND WILL NEVER BE THE TARGET MARKET I know still the majority of protestors are women but they can&#x27;t serious think they&#x27;ll get backlash this is annoying im bored</p>
