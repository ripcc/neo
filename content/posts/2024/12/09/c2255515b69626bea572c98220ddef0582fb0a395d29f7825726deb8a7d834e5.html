      <p>it might be indirectly linked but it isn’t exactly because of gunwook, there have been other idols that were silenced even if they literallly posted a candle on their bios, they then changed it back, so companies generally are trying to keep low with their idols for some reason, whether that is because stockholders have influence on that and connections to politics idk but could be really possible… it makes me think that the kpop industry is seriously fucked up especially with the news that came up yesterday about vcha too /+r/35e056c5d5</p>
