the defense being his chat looking for the nugu nsign member at the backstage when the post was about their drive and eating out with tws only. They&#x27;re even pointing out that he&#x27;s only posting friends from popular groups to get clout and he makes sure to get the popular member. It isn&#x27;t wrong though. They need connections to survive in kpop. The disbandment is nearing and we need the Chuu pipe. We might get streams from the fandom of those popular groups. Let&#x27;s get it!</p>
