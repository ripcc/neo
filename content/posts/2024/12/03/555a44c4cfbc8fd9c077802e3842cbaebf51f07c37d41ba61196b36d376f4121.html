      <p>I know people are making fun of gidle renewing with cube but honestly I think that is probably the best decision considering all the improvised terms that we dont know. If soyeon go solo then both her and the group will fall down, she&#x27;s good in making songs but lets be real sy can&#x27;t thrive by being soloist and the group can&#x27;t thrive without her. And I keep on seeing her videos of saying she put the group first above all so I guess the other companies can&#x27;t fulfill the terms she wanted for the group</p>

      <p>It is the best decision idk exactly what issues soyeon had to be publicly dissing but she was able to get her group this far with that much freedom it would be best to stay even if she went to that new monopoly ass company who knows what would happen. and right shes not established as anything but an idol or that popular on her own so she can&#x27;t go into rap it&#x27;s too late her choice didnt really surprise me hopefully the new terms are good</p>
