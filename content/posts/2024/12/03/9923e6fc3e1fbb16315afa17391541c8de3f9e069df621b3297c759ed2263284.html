      <p>do u know if events will still be cancelled and all that, even tho martial law&#x27;s been lifted? i&#x27;m wondering if zb1&#x27;s concert today will be cancelled bc even tho it&#x27;s in japan, they&#x27;re still kpop artists and korea and japan&#x27;s relationship is touchy obviously</p>

      <p>mmmmm I didn&#x27;t see any official cancellations just that company&#x27;s were advised to so now that it&#x27;s lifted with no motions I don&#x27;t see why they would. But I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised just because now the country&#x27;s on high alert I don&#x27;t think affects their work in Japan just cuz it&#x27;s an internal issue with a president trying to enact a temporary dictatorship most likely things are probably gonna proceed as is especially cuz this all happened around midnight that&#x27;s just my guess tho</p>
