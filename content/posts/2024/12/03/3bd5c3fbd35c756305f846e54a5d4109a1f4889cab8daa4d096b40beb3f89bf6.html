      <p>Thatâ€™s actually hilarious because itâ€™s only counting messages from November and I have haoâ€™s pc and heâ€™s sent messages like nearly every single day ðŸ˜­ what are they mad about ? That he didnâ€™t send 200+ messages a day ? Because he still came pretty much everyday so idek how or why Sinophobia is being bought into it. They actually want him to be mistreated because how are they finding an issue in thatðŸ˜­ /+r/2db328a0da</p>
