      <p>hao himself said 2binz are his happiness “lately” (i cant remember when that was but probably when they started moving in together?) and remember all the anecdotes gyuvin shared how hao bought him mangoes and cut them for him? so it’s not wrong to assume gyuvin is much closer to hao than yujin whom he has never shared a dorm with /+r/4dacaebcaa</p>
