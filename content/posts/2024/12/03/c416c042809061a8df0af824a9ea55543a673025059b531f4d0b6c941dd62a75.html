      <p>Now its been lifted but I&#x27;m pretty sure major broadcasting companies and idol companies were told to start cancelling events almost immediately so who knows what it would&#x27;ve looked like I saw that mbc specifically was being made to? cancel stuff cuz they have programs that speak against the current president I&#x27;m not too sure about that tho I just read it from oomf briefly earlier. I&#x27;m just glad it&#x27;s over and that it ended safely a country almost falling into dictatorship within hours is so scary with the climate we&#x27;re in</p>
