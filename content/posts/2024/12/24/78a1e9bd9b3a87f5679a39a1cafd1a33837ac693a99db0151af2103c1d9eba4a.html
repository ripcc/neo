      <p>Ik no one is watching starlight boys but let me rant for a moment. Thereâ€™s a contestant named Xinche on it that I cannot stand. He canâ€™t sing, he canâ€™t rap, he can only stiffly dance. The whole thing that gets pushed by the show is that he looks like a doll (also helps he has barely any facial expressions, even when heâ€™s dancing ðŸ™„ðŸ˜’). Heâ€™s just a super skinny, highlight wearing, pretty privilege pick. And like of course every survival show is mostly based on looks but it genuinely sucks to see actual talented trainees be constantly sideline for a dude with the personality of celery and the stiffness of a cylinder block. He has rich fans too and is popping off in Asia because heâ€™s a twink anyone can project any identity upon (the perks of not having a personality, am I right?), and like how much money your fans spend is incorporated in scores and ranks so heâ€™s doing really good because of that and is looking like heâ€™ll make the group ðŸ˜¬ðŸ¤¬. The one thing about him I find funny or charming is the fact there are predebut videos of him with his actual ex boyfriend kissing so like thereâ€™s undeniable proof and like slay and representation matters but why couldnâ€™t they get an actual talented, out gay man instead ðŸ˜­. Like fuck, Jesus. Gays are known to be good performers (shoutout Hao, we love you kingy, from one gay to another). Xinche STEP THE FUCK UP. Grrr ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ¤¬</p>
