      <p>The thing is that synchronization has never been as common as some people think when it comes to kpop. I think it&#x27;s a 50:50 ratio when it comes to synced groups vs unsynchronized groups. From the big groups: Aespa, IVE, Red Velvet, BP, EXO, GIDLE, NMIXX struggle with synchronization. While other groups like Newjeans, Itzy, TXT, SVT, Twice, Lessersfim are more synchronized groups. And then there&#x27;s groups that are on the middle ground like Enhypen, SKZ, BTS, etc. On where they are not super synchronized but they don&#x27;t struggle with synchronization either.</p>
