The two ends Hao &amp; Yujin are in sync with Hanbin. I couldn&#x27;t see the details of Gyuvin and Uncle because of the fireworks but they&#x27;re similar to Haobinjin. I couldn&#x27;t see Gunwook too because of the camera but looks the same with the majority &amp; only changed when he moved to the center https://x.com/SUPADUPAMY/status/1869919113268924591?t=tIsuYnhOTqDmWOphK8HZnA&amp;s=19</p>
