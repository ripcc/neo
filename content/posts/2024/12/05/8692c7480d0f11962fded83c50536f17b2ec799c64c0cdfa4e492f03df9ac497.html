      <p>https://www.pannchoa.com/2024/12/theqoo-notice-about-kep1er-xiaotings.html i don&#x27;t quite understand what&#x27;s going on here but seems messy (i think her original company is pulling her out of kep1er activities for a bit to do solo work in china iirc?) ðŸ˜­ according to a comment apparently she posted and deleted a photo of pinocchio on her instagram story</p>
