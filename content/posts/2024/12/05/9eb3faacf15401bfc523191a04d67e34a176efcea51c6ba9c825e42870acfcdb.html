      <p>I don’t care about the topic of discourse but at someone who doesn’t even bias Yujin all I’ll say is don’t underestimate him. He’s improved like crazy over the time he’s spent in zb1 so far like remember he came into this at 15 and he’s only getting better. Idc about who outshines who but if Yujin continues to improve he’s well on his way to being a great performer. /+r/5684986032</p>
