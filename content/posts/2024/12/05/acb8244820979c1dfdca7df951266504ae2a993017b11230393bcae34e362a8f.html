      <p>jaerose ended all those ships im crying idk who the leon guy is tho. It sounds like whoever she dated had to come from money or be in celeb circles without being a celeb probably some industry person. I doubt she was with a regular person especially cuz she moved her life so young and the way she&#x27;s making it sound she liked him first and he didn&#x27;t really like her and she did the chasing ðŸ˜­</p>
