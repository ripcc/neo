      <p>he has a small fandom that engages in bigger fights and the bp hate carried on it&#x27;s just a bad reaction since he&#x27;s the only chinese trainee and he&#x27;s first im not weibo but from what I can gather that&#x27;s it they&#x27;ll get over it eventually Ricky was able to grow a huge fandom even tho he was getting dragged bad</p>
