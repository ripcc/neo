      <p>&quot;Netmarble is South Korea&#x27;s largest mobile-gaming company, total assets (not market value) are about $9 billion(2023). In 2023, it ranked 41 in the list of the largest corporations in Korea. CJ ENM owns 21% of Netmarble&#x27;s shares and is the second-largest shareholder after founder Bang Jun-hyuk. Netmarble is also the second-largest shareholder of HYBE, after Bang Si-hyuk. In other words, CJ ENM actually indirectly owns HYBE&quot;
