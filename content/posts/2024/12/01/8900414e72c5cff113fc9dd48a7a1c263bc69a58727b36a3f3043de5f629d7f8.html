      <p>what?? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ does anon even know what rigging means that means the company/producers themselves intervented to favor someone/make sure they debut by manipulating whatever that could help them debut but like... this is something all fans did that has nothing to do with mnet and they clarified they did their best to not count/filter out clone app votes why would zb1 disband because of this I&#x27;m crying they&#x27;re not rigged some of your anons need to start putting their thinking caps on before they speak /+r/8c4312d82c</p>
