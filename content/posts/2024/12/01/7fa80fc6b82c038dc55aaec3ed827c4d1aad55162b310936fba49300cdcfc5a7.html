      <p>hanbin is very good at the dances he specializes in but the dance challenges they do don’t really play to his strengths. whenever he does a challenge with matthew I get why the comments are mainly focused on matthew because I’ve noticed he’s much looser in his movements and excels in hip hop style choreo (gunwook too). hanbin is great at sharp and detailed movements but in the sticky challenge for example I actually found him a little stiff. I’m not a dance expert by any means but matthew looks more relaxed to me when he dances and it’s satisfying to watch (the gimme gimme more challenge is another good example of this) /+r/5046f825a2</p>

      <p>Yea I get it too they&#x27;re both groovier than hanbin it&#x27;s a more widely enjoyed dancing style so esp for casual things like tiktok challenges that don&#x27;t require hella practice eyes always go to them also they&#x27;re some of the best performers in the group too</p>
