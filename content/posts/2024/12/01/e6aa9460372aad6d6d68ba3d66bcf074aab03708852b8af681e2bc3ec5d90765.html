      <p>gunwook&#x27;s self-made rap kinda give me realization why i wanna slap him in the head sometimes. like bro is another capricorn whose ambition is great with both talent and brain to back it up, but not greedy because they are perfectionist mfs with unreasonable standard of good and &#x27;greatness takes time&#x27; mentality. i stan too many capricorns like him and even tho they did achieve that greatness plus that mentality is actually good, it is not suitable for current fast paced idol industry. he should try another route to be a relevant singer</p>

      <p>the way he just shat on himself and said the self produced song wasn&#x27;t good enough for a behind OH ITS BLEAKKKKKKK ðŸ˜­ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’” I wish he had the greed but yea you&#x27;re right his pace for his craft doesn&#x27;t work well with the idol world and he would never go the solo route not for a long time.. I think I might hurt myself if we have to watch him just waste away potential wise like I want him to stay an idol for a while but who know how long that&#x27;ll last UGHHHHHHHH it&#x27;s crazy how he was able to whip that snippet up within a couple hours and it was actually good and we got other people threatening to release music oh ok..</p>
