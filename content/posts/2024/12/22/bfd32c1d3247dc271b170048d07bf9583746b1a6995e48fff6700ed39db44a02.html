      <p>Hao and yujin apologizing and the whole issue being muddled up with that sweat video kinda worked in their favor bc now ktrolls are saying &#x27;why are they the ones apologizing when they were the only ones doing it right while the rest who messed up are being too cocky&#x27; prolly bc of the plus chats of the members ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
