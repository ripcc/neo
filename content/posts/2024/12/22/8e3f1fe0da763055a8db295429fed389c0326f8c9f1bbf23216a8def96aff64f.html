      <p>the luckyz and mattbin push has been so obvious. don’t get me wrong matt in are definitely close but they are definitely being pushed as a duo too, it’s funny because hanbin is a lot closer to gyuvin and hao. at least when 2binz was pushed it made sense because they’re weirdo kids together and actually like each other god knows why.</p>

      <p>I wouldn&#x27;t call that a push they haven&#x27;t done anything close to luckyz imo like if their duo schedule didn&#x27;t exist there wouldn&#x27;t be much</p>
