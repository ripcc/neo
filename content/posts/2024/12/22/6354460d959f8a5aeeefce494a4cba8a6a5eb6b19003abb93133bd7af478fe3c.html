      <p>the dance situation wasn&#x27;t that big in korean tweet. It&#x27;s big inside our fandom, yes. But outside, it&#x27;s only few usual hater accounts. the post actually didn&#x27;t go viral. no subtweets. As for the apologies, those are obviously for the people who were feeling offended because if those were for the dance, they&#x27;ll say they&#x27;ll work hard. Hao and yujin don&#x27;t use twitter much. Their apologies were about what they were receiving on their plus chats /+r/89f4f4422f</p>
