      <p>momentum during gsb on what? MV views? guys, we don&#x27;t have organic &quot;momentum&quot;.ðŸ˜­ Our views are paid for by Wakeone and Allins. Not to mention the innate laziness of our fandom. This is why it&#x27;s hard to create this illusion that we&#x27;re doing good because some people won&#x27;t bother moving.the biggest factor is actually the fact that there&#x27;s nothing interesting to watch now. they don&#x27;t add something new. same old boring routine /+r/07295200ab</p>
