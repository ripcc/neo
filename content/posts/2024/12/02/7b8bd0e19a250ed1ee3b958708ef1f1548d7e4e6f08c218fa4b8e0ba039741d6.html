      <p>Isnt this why people or some kfans think thats their difference with jihoon or that tutting expert in tws? As he is so good in tutting but is also groovy?  He is basically hanbin in tutting but is better in everything else.
Their onlly difference too is pledis is giving jihoon creative freedom on doing performances as well https://neospring.org/+r/7fa80fc6b8</p>

      <p>I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s better at tutting I would say it&#x27;s hanbin since he actually trained but it&#x27;s not like tws do anything cool so creative freedoms debatable</p>
