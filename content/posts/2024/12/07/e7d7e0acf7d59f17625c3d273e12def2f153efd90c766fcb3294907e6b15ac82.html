      <p>sorry i love them but going public instead of the legal route is so stupid because anyone with some law knowledge knows theyre doing this because they don&#x27;t have much evidence legally so they&#x27;re trying to get public sympathy but this can easily backfire because what company would want them now knowing the extent theyll go /+r/34766f27f5</p>

      <p>i think their goal is to be under mhj no matter what like watching all this unfold i doubt theyre trying to get taken by anyone they want mhj specifically and theres been rumors about hyeins uncle having some company? idk but theyre also new jeans i think even with this public protest theyd still be a commodity worth peoples money cuz the public really supports them to the fullest. and tbh i dont see what else they couldve done since the legal route isnt really working at least they gave a fight trying if it blows up in their faces</p>
