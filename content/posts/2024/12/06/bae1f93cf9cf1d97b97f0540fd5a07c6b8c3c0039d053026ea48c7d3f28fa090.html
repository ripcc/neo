      <p>Her fans mostly are still blaming wakeone (klap) which imo makes no sense because the Pinocchio pic was posted after top classes statement not wakeone and she posted personally on her bubble that the kr company have been good to her (though her fans are convinced wakeone has access too and is controlling her bubble 😭) the way I see it is she wouldn’t have resigned if she didn’t like the company and terms of resigning probably gave top class a lot more control over her schedules than wakeone which is probably why she’s not attending kr schedules over china ones /+r/a9a2c0f99f</p>
