      <p>https://x.com/soompi/status/1864846503187202473?t=0dSpHxKezj6AgU4rlo06eg&amp;s=19 Idk if you know him but he&#x27;s yohan p01 producex101. I&#x27;ve come into conclusion that once these idols go into acting while being in a flop group or soloist they will definitely prioritize the one that bring more money to them. I kinda feel sad cause I remember he even gave up taekwando just for the sake of being an idol that he want so much but now it&#x27;s very rare to even see him singing. I hope to see jebi members to sing for a long time I just felt a bit emo when artist that I stan does not do things that turn me as their fan</p>
