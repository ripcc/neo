      <p>I doubt there&#x27;s txt fans over here but I accidentally bumped into a tweet and now I am curious, why some moas say that Wooyoung (ATEEZ) doesn&#x27;t like Beomgyu and the reason it&#x27;s bc he was the last addition to txt while he didn&#x27;t make it into the group? And they seem pretty convinced of it.</p>
