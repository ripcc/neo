      <p>I am not saying that their male fans isn&#x27;t a problem but their male fans won&#x27;t be making up theories and trying to cope, they will just be like omg she&#x27;s horrible why is she dating when she&#x27;s an idol and then move onto the next female idol. But we all know that the shippers love coping and making up theories so they can keep thinking that their ship is real.</p>
