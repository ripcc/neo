      <p>I&#x27;m reading some of the Korean and Chinese comments on weverse and why do they always say &#x27;we believe you&#x27; when a dating scandal breaks out? Do they mean believe that you&#x27;re not dating? That they&#x27;re single? That he didn&#x27;t &#x27;cheat&#x27; on us fans? Or what /gen</p>
