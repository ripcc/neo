I think I was 11 and for three years straight they brought me to these new years parties and I did not fuck with the teens there at all like you can smell the bad vibes and it was just a miserable time like they all a bunch of reginas so for the third year I was like fuck this shit I&#x27;m staying in the car and took a fat nap for 4 hours until it was over and guess what? When I went back to school after winter break my friend started hugging me and saying shit like I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t know how bad it was but now I do and you can always talk to me and I was like wtf u on and she was like she heard from her friend who goes to another school who has a friend that knows me because of our parents and said how I had relationship problems with my parents and as punishment theyd make me sleep in the car (im from florida so it aint cold here) and I was like huuhhhhh she said what now??? and apparently my parents are on the verge of divorce because my dad has a mistress who&#x27;s my FUCKINGGG AUNT AND THAT RUMOR STARTED BECAUSE HE SAID I LOVE YOU ON HER BIRTHDAY ON FACEBOOK BUT BECAUSE MY AUNT MARRIED HER LAST NAME CHANGED SO IT WASNT THE SAME AS MY DAD SO THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS HIS MISTRESS and how my mom is an recovering alcoholic because she doesnt drink like HUHHHHHH?!? also for the past three years apparently I was abused by my parents because they saw a bruise on my forehead the first year BUT IT WAS BECAUSE I WALKED INTO A FUCKING DOORRRR omfggg like I barely know these people and they be gossiping about me at another fucking schoool omfgg like I&#x27;m still so pissedddd like sometimes u just gotta cut ppl off esp if u dont need to be there in the first place like just bad ass fucking vibes omfg sorry for crashing out /+r/1309068303</p>
