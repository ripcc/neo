      <p>Anon idc how people try and spin it but going out your way to go to a ssng exhibition was a stupid move, going to a duo exhibition when you have never been to a solo one was a stupid move, going to an exhibition with a member your company is so obviously trying to push you with as a duo and whose a minor is a stupid move. It’s not about upsetting fans it’s about understanding that looking at the situation for what it is, it was a bunch of stupid decisions that he as an adult agreed too. Members have apologised for things before directly and sure there were people who didn’t want them to apologise ect but they did and the fact is no one can turn around and use it against them and say they never apologised or addressed someone. When he’s consistently vague about what he’s apologising for every single fan group picks and chooses what to believe his messages are about. Take this recent one for example, that vagueness made his solo and Luckyz shipper fans tweak out and blame haobinist when as a matter of face it was more obvious he was apologising about attending a ssng exhibition and had be been more direct about it a lot of fighting would have been spared. /+r/1309101969</p>
