      <p>The whole discussion with jebi losing recognition obviously true but the main reason would be the incompetency of  small company managing their artist. Thats why I dgaf when shtdoor said their fav is organic like there&#x27;s no group from big4 company is organic if their fav started as bts then I will give them the flower but that&#x27;s not the case. Let&#x27;s just accept the fate I mean it&#x27;s not that bad zb1 still selling their albums and concert</p>
