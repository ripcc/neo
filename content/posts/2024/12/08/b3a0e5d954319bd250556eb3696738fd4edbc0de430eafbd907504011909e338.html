      <p>I don’t wanna tin hat but I do think regardless if it was Matthew or Hanbin it was an interesting choice for staff to post a pic that was taken on the 2nd on the 7th. And the photo was taken on hanbin’s phone so they deffo knew it was him because Matthew has a Samsung. Idk I just think if the company had the foresight to not let them post on bubble the whole day after overlooking that detail seems stupid af but then again this is wakeone. But like anon said at least kfans are being reasonable this time for both hb and gw and realising how insane it is to say they have a political stance over hoodies both have been spotted wearing for weeks beforehand. /+r/4a4a634c9d</p>

      <p>i meannnn the only person who caused an issue was bbosongee so its not like it was a general sentiment that people would take caution for and like someone said it isnt election day so this kinda surveillance would make no sense and they post old pics all the time who knows if matthew wanted to add it or not</p>
