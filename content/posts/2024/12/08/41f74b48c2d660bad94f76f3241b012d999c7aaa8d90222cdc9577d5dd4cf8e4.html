      <p>I think it was on the verge of spoiling something about the kr cb with the way they reacted in general because we know they already did the photoshoots ect for the kr cb since matthe kinda already spoiled it in his live when he mentioned that thing about hair colours. Also these boys don’t even know their own schedule half the time or what they are doing so most likely they don’t even know what’s been released or what hasn’t. /+r/2cdef461a5</p>
