      <p>Doubt he’s done surgery because something on the stomach area would take a longer time to heal and he wouldn’t be able to dance for ages but we have pretty consistent dance videos of him predebut (speaking as someone who got excess skin removed after I lost a lot of weight) plus he lost a lot of his weigh pretty young so it definitely held most it’s elasticity. I think the simple answer and anyone whose ever been overweight can probably agree is that even if you lose it you never really lose the mindset of wanting to cover up and that can be for a variety of different reasons but even now I’ve lost weight and work and and I’m quite toned I still can’t wear things like bikinis because it’s a subconscious thing of not letting certain parts of me be shown that I trypically would have covered when I was bigger. I’m not saying that’s 100% him but I don’t think we have to deep everything to surgery when there’s very obvious answers as to why he may not want to especially when you consider his past and even the struggles he seems to still have with his body now /+r/b2b8a3ff36</p>
