      <p>damn anon said what I wanted to say and for us I guess we can compare it to school? asians aren&#x27;t smart by genetics but because of discipline from their parents and hours of studying after school and going to tutoring etc while most of us chill, play games and browse the internet. Cultural difference is a huge factor but like anon said of coarse morally it aint right, asians deserve a childhood too where they enjoy life but it is what it is to get that high grades andin kpop it&#x27;s that 100% insync rate type of result in a short time. /+r/659b366d40</p>
