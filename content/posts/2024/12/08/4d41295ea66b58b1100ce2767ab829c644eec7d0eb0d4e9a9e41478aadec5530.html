      <p>I donâ€™t get people who make comments like that tho like donâ€™t yall wash your clothes in between or if itâ€™s something like a jacket over a top underneath then itâ€™s fine to wear again ðŸ˜­ also people have favourite colours or lucky colours they wear often so thatâ€™s not odd but he deffo hyperfixates on clothes like those brown shoes heâ€™s re bought a couple times, flannel shirts, even that hamster doll Iâ€™m sure a hyperfixation. /+r/fc58ca34c5</p>
