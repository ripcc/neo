      <p>Dude whoever their staff is set Hanbin up ðŸ˜­ I think they mistaken Hanbin for Matthew in Matthew&#x27;s ig photodump because Hanbin was randomly in the last pic for some reason when it&#x27;s clearly a Matthew centric post and bosongee 2.0 tried to get him jumped with the red hoodie but luckily kstans aren&#x27;t stupid like you guys said</p>
