      <p>Some of those korean fuckers in the quotes were saying &quot;they wore it before the martial law? then why did they wear it when they entered korea on the 6th 3 days after the martial law was declared? They know the sensitivity with those colors yet they wore it ENTERING the country proves their stance&quot; I&#x27;m so annoyed and pissed off but luckily those Korean quotes aren&#x27;t showing up on the english side.... /+r/91f3842784</p>
