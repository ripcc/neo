      <p>I actually think we can because Iâ€™m seeing so many knetz being playful and bashing the president saying because he did martial law now hanbin canâ€™t wear his obsession jacket anymore ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ also people are giving alot of other anecdotes about him / his personality which non fans are talking about (in a good way) in the qrts too so I hope they at least check him out a lil further and then in turn check out zb1 because while the overall situation is shit it actually turned into something positive for him because heâ€™s getting good attention from knetz atm /+r/bfca27f7cf</p>
