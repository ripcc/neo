      <p>I think knets were more mad that instead of choosing to speak up he decided to post about himself so I guess it&#x27;s either speak up about the issue or not say anything at all because it comes of self centered like you have the ability to speak up, you have the platform and freedom but chose not to and then comparing it to everyone who did speak up whether subtly like saying dress warmly or candle emojis /+r/eeecc48481</p>
