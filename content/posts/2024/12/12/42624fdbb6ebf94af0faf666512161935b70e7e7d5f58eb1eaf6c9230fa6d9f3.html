      <p>there is a real problem in this fandom where shipping content is what people are always introduced to first and they become shippers before actually caring or knowing about any of the members as people</p>

      <p>people who get into the group because of shipping content were always going to be shippers and or casual fans like i really dont care just cuz whoever comes across them and is actually interested will stan them and get to know them. the shipping content isnt whats stopping them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and youre making it sound like there arent new genuine fans joining all the time were good bruh</p>
