      <p>apparently woongdeongies are calling haobin shady and greedy for posting those selfies and then the video imitating jiwoong but like do members even acknowledge the other members&#x27; birthdays that much period (and even then they still mentioned jiwoong in the post so lmao).....? like i feel like they always post on other members&#x27; birthdays regardless. but hey if haobin are shading jiwoong by imitating him and posting selfies then i like the shade give me more shade üòÅ</p>
