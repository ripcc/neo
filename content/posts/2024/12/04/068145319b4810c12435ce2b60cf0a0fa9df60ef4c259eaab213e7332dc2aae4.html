      <p>Isn&#x27;t it curated to Hanbin&#x27;s? Like the many arm movements. Most of the boys look better in hiphop but the choreos look like the styles that Hanbin had during predebut and he said himself that he&#x27;s participating in choreo adjustment because we&#x27;ve seen how they change from the original that are more on hiphop side rather than jazzy, interpretative and ballroom. /+r/ff8d103bdc</p>

      <p>their choreos are def gg like more than anything which does have a bunch of arm movements but I think their choreos are just awkward in general they never ever have good point choreo either but idk if we can say it leans into hanbins style I never thought that while watching them perform wedemboyz has done the most for them and they just seem to throw anything at a wall I think motf has done 2 things for them and they were aiiiight I wish we could see heavier hip hop elements tho</p>
