      <p>so many dumb kpop stans dont understand why cancelling these year end events are so important and how dangerous it is because if they actually used their brains and think, imagine a group of highly influential people all crammed in one place, under one roof and this event location, date and time is announced to the entire world and if something bad happened KNOCK ON WOOD like its easy target for high casualties from both normal civilians and influential ppl if some crackhead with military power decides to take action /+r/1b207c2cda</p>

      <p>people refusing to engage in important world events or just reading up on history causes all this because if we go based off of the last time martial law was called civilians were getting massacred cooping up people in stadiums and arenas by the thousands is an immediate target like fjjdjcmdmdmdmmf im glad everything worked out who knows what could&#x27;ve happened I saw Korean tweets saying social media and international attention helped a lot plus there being no foundation helped the collapse of the call</p>
