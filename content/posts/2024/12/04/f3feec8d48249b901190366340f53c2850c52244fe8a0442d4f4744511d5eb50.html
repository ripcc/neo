      <p>................ the way my heart dropped don&#x27;t even speak that out like wow I had to hold back cussing them out. I don&#x27;t think anything points towards may and just going off the timeline of spoilers and when their japan cb is it seems like they&#x27;re following an identical plan to 2024 just 2 months earlier so I say March for that reason. I still think that&#x27;s too late even omg a May cb would break my heart LIKE THATS ACTUALLY SO UPSETTING AND SAD THEY BETTERRRRRRR NOT IM SO SERIOUS their last cb would&#x27;ve been in august they wasted an entire quarter on an asia tour then had a Japanese cb late january like the nerve of them that sounds 10x worse than this entire year everyone start praying</p>
