      <p>might be controversial but mattbin have very little chemistry as a duo, and even lesser as performers. theyâ€™re obviously good friends but their styles do not match each other at all and iâ€™m not sure why they get paired up a lot, or why people even want to see it. itâ€™s quite painful to watch because i think theyâ€™re both good dancers but very very different. hanbin is a lot more technical while matthew is groovier. they just both make the other look bad and end up looking bad themselves together, sorry. matthewâ€™s best pairing for dance would be gunwook. hanbin probably yujin. /+r/131682758560013827</p>
