        <p>Myung jaehyun is so interesting to me because he is SO much and can be an attention seeker but like I really do like the tone of his voice and willingness to just be himself, even if it is super cringy. I really wonder how he&#x27;s going to be like when he gets a bit older and matures. Don&#x27;t write him off y&#x27;all, I think he&#x27;ll be pretty cool in a couple years (or if he ever starts ADHD meds. The raspy nature of his voice is also really good and he&#x27;s not a bad rapper.</p>
