        <p>I’m not one to glaze hanbin esp not on platforms like this but anon you can’t be serious. I’ve seen most of wonys own fans prefer this duo and their visual chemistry. Also idk what you mean by washed because both looked good and both have very diffrent visuals. /+r/131760246254426339</p>

      <p>well exactly cs lots of my mutuals r dives and ive seen dives agreeing wonyoung and hanbin being a better duo and idk but wony and hanbin have quite similar visuals like not similar features or anything but the vibes their visuals give its like soft likeable and princely vibes they looked like two prince and princess especially in the white outfit /+r/131772973618254493</p>
