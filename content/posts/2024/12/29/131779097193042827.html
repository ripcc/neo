        <p>might be controversial but mattbin have very little chemistry as a duo, and even lesser as performers. they’re obviously good friends but their styles do not match each other at all and i’m not sure why they get paired up a lot, or why people even want to see it. it’s quite painful to watch because i think they’re both good dancers but very very different. hanbin is a lot more technical while matthew is groovier. they just both make the other look bad and end up looking bad themselves together, sorry. matthew’s best pairing for dance would be gunwook. hanbin probably yujin. /+r/131682758560013827</p>

        <p>okay I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that far but agree they are pretty different it&#x27;s just pretty obvious in tiktoks I think the only time they got paired up was last gda and mama this year right for those it was okay but the tiktoks are ehhhh</p>

      <p>i’m the anon trolling about mix and max but yes i agree their dance styles don’t really complement each other like all the tiktoks they did were much groovier which matt excels in so his dance lines look really good while hanbin looks a bit stiff except for the v lee jung cover. the steps has more technicalities and are sharp so hanbin looks better than matt there. yujins skill is a bit lacking until he fixes certain habit that make his dance lines look a little weird to me (sorry yujinie) unfortunately hanbin don’t really have a dance partner that could complement him well /+r/131743678262892515</p>
