      <p>He was listed as an individual trainee for project 7 so maybe he’s not confirmed in thel1ve or they only signed him properly after p7. He’s got a nice face and he’s quite talented too, plus in the year they wait for hb (if he is going to redebut with him) they will obviously train him up a lot. I’m suprised he didn’t make the lineup tbh he was floating between rank 7-9 for most the show so I did expect him to make it. /+r/131787478809137197</p>
