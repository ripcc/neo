      <p>I donâ€™t agree with anon because wakeone could be doing more for ot9 schedules but in this instance it doesnâ€™t make sense for it to be the whole group because they arenâ€™t promoting and also they are acting as mcs. Kstars next door is on break till spring 2025 if you look at the tags on the post it says world stars next door which seems to be a spin off so they arenâ€™t there as the guest but as 2 MCs for the first ep. /+r/131776678937710794</p>
