        <p>he has a small fandom that engages in bigger fights and the bp hate carried on it&#x27;s just a bad reaction since he&#x27;s the only chinese trainee and he&#x27;s first im not weibo but from what I can gather that&#x27;s it they&#x27;ll get over it eventually Ricky was able to grow a huge fandom even tho he was getting dragged bad</p>

      <p>The reaction to ricky wasn&#x27;t too bad on though if you check old weibo comment sections and forums from last april it was mostly matthew that people had an issue withðŸ˜­ due to bp editing but now czeroses like matt and defend him so we pray the same happens to mjx I know there&#x27;s residual bp beef that carried over but the poor guy is getting such disproportionate amounts of hate it&#x27;s all jealousy to me they&#x27;re saying he was rigged as center but that makes no sense like just accept that your faves didn&#x27;t have as much fanbase power /+r/131722898586163847</p>

      <p>I just needed something to compare it to BFNNFNFNFM but hopefully it subsides he&#x27;s kinda just in a bad spot but he clearly is liked enough to get 1st Koreans find him gorg too WERE WISHING THIS GOAT WELLLL</p>
