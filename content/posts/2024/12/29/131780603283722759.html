        <p>The pre recording is getting postponed a lot... It was supposed to be started by 7:30 and I just saw a few bnd fans complaining about still waiting for the recording... It must be so hard for them... I saw fans of groups who have already completed their recording complain about not eating and waiting for hours.</p>
