      <p>er i was on that live and i didn’t see any comments complaining about his styling tho but the thing is he hasn’t been on live for almost a month, so rather than him trying to please his fans i think that was his only chance to go live after ban was lifted cuz he knows how busy he will be after that day with AAA gayo and other award shows and lets bfr we’re talking about the guy who goes on pc daily and had among the most pc lives /+r/131685662347973942</p>
