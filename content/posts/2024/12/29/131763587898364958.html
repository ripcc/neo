        <p>https://x.com/Hazzzie_/status/1873050792271528390 This is so cuteðŸ¥¹ can zb1 be a permanent group please. It is such a small moment but I really like it, the way yujin the youngest is assuring his hyung that he did well but to Hanbin, yujin is like a little brother to be taken care of.</p>

      <p>Not directly about this anons ask but Iâ€™ve been depressed af lately now the reality of them not extending has settled it. Idk what hit me maybe the constant talk of time, the little comment hao made about remainder of activities even little things like those project 7 fans thinking their faves are going to redebut with hb (donâ€™t really believe that one) but all these little things makes me realise thereâ€™s no point even having a little hope for negotiations ect because it seems pretty set in stone /+r/131742679112571364</p>
