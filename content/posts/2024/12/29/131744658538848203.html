      <p>that jeju airline was tragic. so many kpop fans who attended AAA were there. may they rest in peace. I&#x27;m thinking of these birds because Azerbaijan also encountered birds. Are you aware that there are military drones now that look like birds. I&#x27;m not sure how high then can fly or if they can reach the altitude of airplanes</p>
