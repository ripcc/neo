      <p>nuh uh I disagree on some 🙋‍♀️ -GUNWOOK AINT NO HOE! 😡 but icl he does give flirtatious vibes and having multiple crushes at once 😭 BUT he doesnt seem like he;ll cheat like he aint dumb he KNOWS BETTER
-Hao... oop if u get a barrage of rosins im sorry but I can see anon opinion 😭 idk like am I nasty if I say he&#x27;ll cheat but blame his partner for causing him to cheat? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 -Hanbin is to uptight idt he&#x27;ll cheat consciously like hes gotta be going through it 5 soju bottles down where he doesnt know wtf hes doing anymore and gets taken advantage on like it aint his doing.
-ricky only has like 3 friends and he didnt even add yuqi back on wechat 💀and shes like friendliest person ever 😭 i think ppl look at his image too much and forget what his personality really is like and RIGHT exactly he gon commit to one and get freaky with her 😳 /+r/9e3ee4672f</p>
