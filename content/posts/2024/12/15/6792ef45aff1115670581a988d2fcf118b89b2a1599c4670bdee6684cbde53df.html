      <p>Semi agree but he still washed them regardless. The guy from nnsign was alright but he didn’t stand out much and shinyu stood out but not in the good way like they really should have put another member in there. I heard they only got 1 day to practice it tho so I can see why he was focusing more on nailing the dance but wow watching this made me realise how goated zb1 are because I think even our ‘weakest’ members could have washed the other two /+r/1a80d718b0</p>
