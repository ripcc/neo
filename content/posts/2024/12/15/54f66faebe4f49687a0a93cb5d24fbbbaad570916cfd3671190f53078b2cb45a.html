      <p>Agree for most but my disagreements are: Gunwook ehhhh so basically one night stands? I can&#x27;t see it or maybe I&#x27;m just coping cuz that&#x27;s my wookie bear but yeah I think he&#x27;ll flirt with others while in a relationship cuz he&#x27;s just flirtatious bit nothing more. Ricky I feel like these are takes from ppl who don&#x27;t know him yet but yeah agree with queef once u know more about him he&#x27;s like the down bad commited foe life type, he barely let&#x27;s anyone inside his circle. Gyuvin I think he&#x27;ll cheat without knowing, not physically but like be overly flirty with someone while in a relationship cuz he doesn&#x27;t know boundaries and that led that person on and that person thinks they&#x27;re dating but to gyuvin he was just friendly and then bam gf finds out and think hes cheating /+r/9e3ee4672f</p>
