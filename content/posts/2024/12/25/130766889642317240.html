      <p>anons talking alot of shit but wheres the actual evidence honey ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è wakeone is not picking and choosing who to give ads to. if they were to pick and chose trust that the members with the closest cjnm/yuehua ties would be the ones to get the ads. atp everybody knows who is controlling and managing this group. no conpany invests in individuals that are not under them/benefits them. thats how the industry works and has been /+r/72c141c11a</p>
