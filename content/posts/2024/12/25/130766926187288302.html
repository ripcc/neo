      <p>Yeah I think it&#x27;s fair to wish his messages had more clarity and I don&#x27;t agree with all the ways he&#x27;s handled things but it feels like that&#x27;s just how he is even that one long message asking for support where he was tweaking about bp2 and not having much time left a few weeks ago was vague imo he very much avoids directly naming what he&#x27;s referring to even when he&#x27;s not apologizing for things so you always have to infer based on context in both good and bad situations /+r/d76aee918c</p>

      <p>Yea tbh it&#x27;s his personality he doesn&#x27;t wanna be direct I think it&#x27;s cuz he just doesn&#x27;t wanna say sorry for something he did that upset people maybe a pride thing idk like you really have to just be in the know the get it. And I wonder why cuz it doesn&#x27;t even clear anything up it sparks up more drama like BFNNDNDMDMFMFM GET A NEW METHOD</p>
