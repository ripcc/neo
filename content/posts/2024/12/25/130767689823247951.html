      <p>okay gunwook and jiwoong ate i hate unc but i think he was actually the right choice for this gunwook was amazing per usual he really is an amazing performer and stole the show. Karina and yujin&#x27;s performance was also v good karina does have this sensual quality which most female idols lack today and i think it&#x27;s a reason why she stands out so much</p>
