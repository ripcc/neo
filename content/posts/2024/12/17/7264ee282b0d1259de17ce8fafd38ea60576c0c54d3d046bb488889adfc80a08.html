      <p>(Same anon, accidently hit ask early.) Like some of the people calling him that genuinely didnt feel underhanded at all but were taken badly by people they werent friends with, as is the usual course of social media. With that being said, this made me realize that lots of fans either werent present for or just forgot/dont care about how people used to tag him as that in a negative way back during bp and so while gpds can be really tender sissies over all the wrong things, this one kinda makes sense to be sensitive over since it was definitely said more negatively in recent history. Personally the only thing im a bit irked about is how he gets called stuff like that way more than members who actually watched the fight or are just as boyish as he is and we all know its bc of looks and fans&#x27; goldfish memory. (Oh and also how this inevitably turns into a &quot;you guys dont know him at all like i do&quot; dumb parasocial war when the truth is he&#x27;s multifaceted and duality of masculine/feminine exists in everyone but especially demonstrably him js.)</p>

      <p>&quot;I dont like adding to these terminally online discourses but based off what i saw it&#x27;s clear that a term like dudebro has different connotations some more negative and accusatory are others light-hearted and jesting.&quot; I&#x27;ll add the first part of your ask! For me it was worsened cuz I dislike the person who tweeted it and mischaracterization has become my biggest pet peeve since being a zrose like ouuuu u gotta smoke urself sorry. But agreeeeeeeeeeeeeeee I think generally the connotation is never positive and couple with gwks history it&#x27;s 10x worse how come gyv and jwg never got the title even tho they were just as if not more into the whole thing WHICH MIND U WAS AN INTERNATIONAL SENSATION EVERYONE WATCHED IT ugh but i feel like atp there is a point where some groups of people will never understand ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
