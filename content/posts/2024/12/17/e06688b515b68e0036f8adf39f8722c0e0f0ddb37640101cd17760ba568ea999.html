      <p>nah because why are they actin like this age difference isn’t literally a normal real life college/uni age difference in couples plus they had their first interactions when gunwook was 18 years old not 16 or something not that I think they are dating eo or something but these people try to act moral and above over something that doesn’t need it /+r/be610a9760</p>
