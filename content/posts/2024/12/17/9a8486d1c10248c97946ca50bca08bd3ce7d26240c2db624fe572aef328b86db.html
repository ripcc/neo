      <p>who do you think have least and highest standards for partner? least
1 yujin he dates for dating anyone who is pretty like for 1-2 weeks
2 taerae he has constant crushes on someone who looks like his type
3 matthew I guess he just needs a person who matches his vibe
4 gyuvin no smoke, no drinking, pretty, touchy, rich highest
1.hanbin once he said he&#x27;d date himself so I think he has the same requirements as for himself
2.ricky he has a hard time opening up to people + he&#x27;s tall, rich, handsome
3.hao he&#x27;s pretty, smart, popular, rich, loves being spoiled and he&#x27;s also a LEO
4. jiwoong he has a lot of life experience (?)</p>
