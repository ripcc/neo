      <p>Does anyone rmb back in cc days when u guys were debunking his ps claims and an anon dropped a fansite pic of him next to this diver license pic and he looked EXACTLY THE SAME It was when he had white hair and he was kinda sticking his tongue out to the side but holy fuck he looked exactly the same and all these plastic surgery accusations are so fake news since then to me. Like he&#x27;s actually natural as fuck /+r/20eb30fc78</p>
