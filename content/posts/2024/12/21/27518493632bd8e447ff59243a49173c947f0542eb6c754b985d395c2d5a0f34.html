      <p>https://x.com/_o11o_wook/status/1870330346665029986 i saw one of these pics without context and thought this was one of those seasonâ€™s greetings things the whole group did but nope itâ€™s just him, iâ€™m guessing for 05z idols? yayyyyyy. so THEN i searched to see who else is involved but there was hardly any posts about it except a few prior to it coming out from a new fifty fifty fan which said one of the memberâ€™s there would be in the issue and it literally had gunwookâ€™s name in the screenshot but i never saw a post about this from a zerose like idk if i missed that but ðŸ˜­ if they fr didnâ€™t know then how did a god damn fifty fifty fan know before us wow zb1 fanbases arenâ€™t shittktnfndncjndn</p>
