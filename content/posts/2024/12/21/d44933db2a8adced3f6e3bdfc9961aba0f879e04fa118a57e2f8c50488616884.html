      <p>I’m being so fr Ariana grande is sooo pathetic for what she and that little leprechaun did to his ex. Arguably the most fragile time in the ex’s life (the possibility of getting postpartum depression which can literally kill, having moved to a new country so no close support system, having to physically and mentally heal from childbirth, having to take care of a newborn, and risking her job as a psychologist (she lost almost all anonymity and it will get harder with her profession due to that)). And the ginger cheats on her with a pop star who has rabid fans and adopts a new racial persona every couple of years. And she couldn’t keep up with Cynthia’s acting in wicked. Plus ms.homewrecker befriended all those popcrave ass Twitter pages to stop them from negative press. Gross ass bitch. Fuck the man too frfr but Ari got a way bigger fanbase which has harassed the ex. Just imagine being in the ex’s shoes. They both rotting in hell. Imma stream some Mariah Carey for fun now.</p>
