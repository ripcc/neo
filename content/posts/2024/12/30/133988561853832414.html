        <p>the call with matthew in the new zbtving was kinda crazy like i didn&#x27;t know they were chill like that.. i was gonna say it was a video so he could&#x27;ve been playing it up but idk if it was even mentioned to him that they were filming. i thought they&#x27;d be a lottttt more awkward with him, especially bc it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re the companies original trainees (minus taerae) so i expected a bit of distance since he&#x27;s like one of the most important figures in the company iykwim /+r/1309069326</p>
