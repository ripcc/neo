      <p>My hot take is that Holland (that one out gay singer) is actually not a great singer and his only claim to fame is the fact he’s representing being gay. He can’t sing, can’t dance, is friends with Hyuna, a HYBE bootlicker and is wildly unfunny. If he was straight no one would care about him. People argue he isn’t a good singer because he’s indie and didn’t have a company that supplies vocal training… like Bffr it’s been years and he still can’t hold a note.
