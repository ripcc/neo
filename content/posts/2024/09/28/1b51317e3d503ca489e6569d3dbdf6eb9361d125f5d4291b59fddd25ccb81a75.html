      <p>i kinda like this site cuz you can custom it and when they add the thread function it will be the goat!! but does anyone receive a notification when your anonymous ask is answered? i didnâ€™t receive any</p>

      <p>it&#x27;s gonna be toooo tea if that thread function happens like this might&#x27;ve been a blessing in disguise but you guys got notifications even if you weren&#x27;t signed in? but uhhh basically you can achieve that still you&#x27;d just have to have an account and u gotta make sure everytime u send smth u turn anon on cuz it&#x27;s not automatic edit: just checked and the developer said its too much to add the function which I get you&#x27;d have to change a lotttt but I think linking will work fine just don&#x27;t click enter so the ask doesn&#x27;t get blown up</p>
