      <p>For svt it&#x27;s kinda different bc yeah they are both from the US but they are also ethnically Korean and they grew with that culture too and the other members with the exception of Jun and Minghao are Korean too so they share a lot of the culture they grew up with,  with the other members too. The thing is that we need to take into account that Yuehua probably have a bunch of other Chinese trainees there, so there&#x27;s big chances of them not getting close bc they just got closer to other Chinese trainees, Hao also had Kuanjui there so he had other trainee friends (maybe not in the company but he had someone to spend time with during his free days). Also Hao is a koreaboo to the bone, he was probably more excited about talking and being friends with other Korean trainees to learn more about the culture and language rather than trying to be friends with all the Chinese trainees.</p>
