      <p>ask on https://neospring.org/@spark ive already explained the feature to the developer and it would take a lot more work since its not an add on feature but reworking foundation i think? so if we get it itll take time you can try tho. i feel bad cuz its harder for you guys but the only suggestion i have is long clicking it doesnt actually open a brand new tab you get a preview of it and if you let go it goes away but i hope its soon i miss the feature</p>
