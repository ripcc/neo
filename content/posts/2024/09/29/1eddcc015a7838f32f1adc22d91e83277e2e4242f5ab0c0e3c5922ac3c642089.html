      <p>About zb1 live performances to me it&#x27;s understandable why kpop idols don&#x27;t sing live for the entirety of concerts and imo id say they sang live a lot (even gyuvin) and the members who sang live the most didn&#x27;t fumble much it&#x27;s expected from matthaobinrae who are the members who sing the most live in general but gunwook and Ricky did very well too like I was pleasantly surprised especially about Ricky because he can go off key a lot
Gyuvin knew when to sing and I respect that at least he&#x27;s really trying
Jiwoong... yeah he should lipsync the whole thing he&#x27;s not good dhzjksllz
Ngl I don&#x27;t want to be too harsh on him because I see the potential but yujin really doesn&#x27;t try sgsjskls like there&#x27;s songs where they barely move they&#x27;re literally sitting down for goodnight and the only thing he sings live is the good night at the end lmaol</p>

      <p>intense choreos yea it&#x27;s a different ballpark I can understand it but they&#x27;re good so I&#x27;d like to see more but I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that they&#x27;re at least trying to sing live someone said their actual mics might be on just lowered but you can hear in a lot of fancams their voices so who knows. But period the ones who sing live less aren&#x27;t dead weight and agree they sound better Ricky&#x27;s def more stable and wow I might have to clap for gyuvin just last year he was smiling instead of singing a couple adlibs okay brothaaaa.
