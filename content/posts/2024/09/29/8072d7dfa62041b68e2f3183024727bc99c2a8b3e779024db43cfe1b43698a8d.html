      <p>Okay I went to singapore con ytd and Okay Lowkey i enjoyed it members were putting so much efforts to interact us w in english. like as a star creator I felt very touched but My one pick didnâ€™t make the final line up I was still in contradiction should I attend or not. But i couldnâ€™t stop my urge to do. I saw many non zerose attending the concert without lightstick I guess all of us just wanted to see the boys.And I didnâ€™t know Hanbin was that handsome in real life. I always found him just a normal guy. But he is super good looking and attractive like he has the fairest skin tone I have ever seen. and RICKY DAMNN HE GOT THAT RIZZ. Others were pretty normal and idk jiwoong looked a bit old w blonde He looks like cementðŸ˜­ðŸ’€</p>
