      <p>idk if u&#x27;ll find this interesting but as someone whos only been a zerose since the beginning of the year this is my PERSONAL ranking of each subfandom (including ifans, kfans, rpsers, solos, akgaes) from least normal to most normal based off MY OWN experiences so yes this is BIASED and my explanations are GENERALIZATIONS rosins / allins - pretty self explanatory they both get realll nasty especially with their sinophobia toward hao/fatphobia toward hanbin &amp; tweak over some of the dumbest shit ðŸ˜­ i ranked them equally but i purposefully put rosins first bc taeraes one of my biases &amp; some akgaes ive seen have been nasty to him over the most silliest reasons ðŸ’”
woongdeongies - i dont think ive ever seen a single k-wdg but the i-wdgs ive seen are enough to put rank them this high every time i see them on my tl theyre always tweaking over the most unserious shit i.e myseokryudan literally having to post clarifying shes not a jiwoong anti bc she didnt record the ppusamz moment that came before the digimonz + mattparkz clip she posted
riyangis - i just find i-riyangis obsession with feminizing him so weirddd especially on the rps side like they fr kill u if u even think abt him topping ðŸ˜­ also the way they tweak over rickys lack of social media presence makes me sooo nervous like its only gonna end up backfiring on him
seokryudans - have been extremely hit or miss for me theyve either chill asf or some of the most annoying people ever theyve relaxed with the witch hunting but omg as a baby zerose that was soooo off-putting
kkultaraes / geonpangdans - not much to say but other than azure &amp; her dickriders most of the ones ive seen are chill + with the ost voting so many of them have showed up on my tl &amp; they seem super nice / even tho i interact with a lot of gunwook content i pretty much never see them on my tl other than the ones i follow but from what ive seen on his i-gpds are pretty chill idk abt k-gpds tho ive barely seen any gyuvinists or mulbokdans so i cant rly place them &amp; wow this is so long sryy</p>
