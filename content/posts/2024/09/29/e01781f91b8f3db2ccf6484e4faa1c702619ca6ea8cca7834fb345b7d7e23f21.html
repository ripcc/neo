      <p>https://neospring.org/+r/419dfeeab6 anon (or u queefie lmao) do u know anything about what k-soul is like now bc i remember a few months ago he was apparently posting on weibo about sick family member(s?) with donation links and stuff? just seemed very stressed/depressed but i can&#x27;t recall the details so i could be getting some of that wrong. like what happened with that? i think splat would&#x27;ve posted about it but i don&#x27;t remember hearing this from anyone else bc fantasy boys are so nugu that no one&#x27;s checking for that, idek anything about the group other than this k-soul stuff</p>
