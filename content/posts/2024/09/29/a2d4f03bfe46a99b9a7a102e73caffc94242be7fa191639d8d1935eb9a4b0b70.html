      <p>About the Jo/dxmon stuff, the old CEO got outted for physically abusing two of the minors in the company’s idol groups. The news came out the literally same day Jo announced his first Hiatus. The ceo has already been replaced but there have been sightings of Jo at school a couple months after the news of his hiatus. All this stuff is semi-viral on Korean Twitter btw. If I was to realistically guess what actually happened (taking into consideration the stabbing rumor), the old CEO might’ve hurt him repeatedly but went the extra level and cut him (not bad enough to not go to school after a few months but still not great) and now Jo is (understandably so) done with the company and idol life (plus he was bullied relentlessly for his hair, don’t forgot on top of likely abuse he was bullied). Poor kid. He seemed super sweet too.</p>
