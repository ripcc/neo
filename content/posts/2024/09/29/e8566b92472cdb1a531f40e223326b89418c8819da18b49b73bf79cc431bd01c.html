      <p>When I binge read your cc for my holiday break, what I did was get on my laptop and if you keep like dragging the scroll bar at the far right down to the bottom repeatedly, and then kind of hold it at the bottom then the page will glitch and auto scroll all the way down for you rlly fast - maybe try that!</p>
