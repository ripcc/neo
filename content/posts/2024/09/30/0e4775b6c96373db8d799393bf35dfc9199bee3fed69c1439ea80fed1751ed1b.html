      <p>To be fair I think there&#x27;s just a group that remained close friends (Yena, Eunbi, Chaewon, Yujin and Minju), others who sometimes hang out with the others but not all the time (Yuri and Hyewon), the ones who barely hang out with just one member (Sakura and Chaeyeon), then there&#x27;s Nako who is always in Japan, Hitomi who recently came back to korea to debut but isn&#x27;t hanging out with the girls yet and Wonyoung who just doesn&#x27;t hang out with them.</p>

      <p>Zamnnnn I guess growing distant and also cliqueing up just does that it&#x27;s not really surprising and again she seems real strict when it comes to relationships and business so it&#x27;s not a surprise</p>
