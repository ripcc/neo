      <p>https://neospring.org/+r/80f2e9f1d3 I would say Jiwoong Hao and Yujin are the members who lost the most of fans have had the most pre debut fansites closing down etc but this might just be my bias as I have been biasing hao since predebut, however Hao and Yujin also had the biggest fandom growth with Ricky so while yes they lost most of their day 1 fans they did make up for it, Gunwook and Hanbin also lost a ton of their day 1 fans and didn&#x27;t make up as much which is fine since they (especially hanbin) have big stable and dedicated fanbases across most markets</p>

      <p>yea the day 1 losses were bad but that was inevitable plus the company driving ppl away but definitely i think theyve had the most ricky especially with kfans gunwook took a third hit because he became an adult ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ hes gained a lot more recently or its just becoming more known he has a big fandom ppl always underestimate that and yea hanbin has his stability and that slower steady gain</p>
