Just to be able to properly anything without the fear of getting stonedü§ïit‚Äôs probs worse for wdgs and haos sf tho. But one time I tweeted out to stop begging for tiktoks cuz we have literally gotten so many anecdotes from the members explaining why he doesn‚Äôt appear often and they still beg it like trust me if he wanted to show smth he would have ! I have no doubt the company has some weird restrictions on him in some way but between the pluschat messages and TikTok‚Äôs I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs them! Sorry!, I said this and it was so funny cuz all my riyangi moots basically agreed w me and the comcensus was ‚Äúyeah idrk why wakeone would habe any reason to sns ban him either‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
