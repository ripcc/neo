      <p>https://neospring.org/+r/dd8fc8c043 I need a compilation of all the members&#x27; reactions to their ssgns. But fr, hao&#x27;s case is interesting, I feel like he wants to pander to all the types of fans he has but he&#x27;s also cautious with ssgns because he knows they&#x27;re on another level of craziness. Blank and her info will forever be missed.
&quot;Hao is jesus to them, he is good enough to his ssfans that they don&#x27;t talk bad about him but he&#x27;s not close to them either, simply ignore them or wave his hand, politely refuse when they come near and that&#x27;s the perfect way to communicate with ssfan.&quot;
&quot;Hao also acknowledges them whenever and whereever but ricky ignores them if they aint supposed to be there&quot;
&quot;for the most part it&#x27;s true how hao is nice to ssgs all the time but ricky is &#x27;selective&#x27; but it goes deep like back in bp&quot;
&quot;Ricky, if he&#x27;s in a public place or on a schedule, he&#x27;ll interact, otherwise he&#x27;ll ignore you or glaring at the camera. He rarely goes out and one time they followed him while he was walking or something like that in the middle of the night so he looked straight at the camera and asked them what they were doing, not even looking at them which made them so f mad lol&quot;
Maybe hao has experience from when he was in uni lmao, sorry I just remembered this fucking video (the first clip) https://x.com/haoesome/status/1639901626025771008 poor guy had stalkers even before he debuted.
