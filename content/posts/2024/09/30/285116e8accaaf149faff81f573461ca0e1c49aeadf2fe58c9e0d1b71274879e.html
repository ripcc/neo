      <p>I think because Ricky is usually quiet (not shy, but quiet) people project their own insecurities or emotions on him. Like no, heâ€™s just a chill guy that grew up in LA. Iâ€™m from Cali and Iâ€™ve meet many So-Cal and even East Bay Asians like him. He isnâ€™t a docile deer being hunted yâ€™all, he just donâ€™t gaf and is down to earth. And he likes to keep it mysterious. Like let him be ðŸ˜­ if anything heâ€™s arguably the most sane member and keeps the best boundaries outside of those cringe ass fan calls he used to get that wanted him to call them his master (thank gawd they stopped).</p>
