      <p>https://neospring.org/+r/fb90eabf6d Being a woke Rosin is different because you are against the SF attitude. You will survive it. Rosins will still interact with you if they like what you talk about Hao. While being a woke Ris or Wdng means that you will have something to say about Ricky and Jiwoong which definitely infuriates the fandom</p>
