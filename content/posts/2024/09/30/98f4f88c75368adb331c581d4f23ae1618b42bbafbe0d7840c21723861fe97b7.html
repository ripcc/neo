      <p>I SEEEENNNNNN I didnt watch but I rmbr when people were happy two black couples won so I kept a mental note. I&#x27;d go on the love island community while both shows were airing and see the uk shit (IT WAS SO IRKSOME) and you could tell Josh had motives like sure he could be nice i didn&#x27;t watch but the way he swooped in for mimii was too quick and they were never spotted tgthr post finale</p>
