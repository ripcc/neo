      <p>i think a good thing about this site is that the developers actually seem to be paying attention and on it bc i was the one last night who was like &quot;aw dang you can&#x27;t see the time of when an ask was posted unless you hover over&quot; and now i come back here and see that you can and i also saw on someone else&#x27;s page they had a link sent to them but i couldn&#x27;t click on it to view, had to copy and paste and put in another tab, but now i can just click the link so clearly they&#x27;re listening to what ppl want omg cc was so busted. i hope this site gets more users from these cc and retrospring closures so it can stay up</p>
