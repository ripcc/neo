      <p>oh wow i kinda wish that u could see how recent ago an ask was answered bc it just shows the date here (unless u like hover over it with the cursor on desktop) but tbh this isn&#x27;t too bad, i do like the search responses thing too. thank god there&#x27;s an alternative ask site, i need my fix ðŸ˜›</p>

      <p>same that&#x27;s my one complaint like a date isn&#x27;t doing shit... but maybe whoever developed this will tap in idk but right this is kinda tea I like the search thing too and I think for threads we&#x27;ll just have to copy links and that&#x27;s fine</p>
