      <p>i&#x27;m not an ahgase so i can&#x27;t contribute much but i do remember hearing years ago that in jj project/got7&#x27;s early days he used to randomly do waacking, i&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t an actual serious thing that he learned like hanbin but something just for fun, and would appear a lot more flamboyant but then he had an image change, became more chilled out and had the typical visual persona which i guess could be to help boost his popularity since male idols who act like lil gay boys aren&#x27;t being seriously stanned like that. however i feel like it&#x27;s probably pretty likely that even after the image switch he naturally grew up and wasn&#x27;t as energetic (tho once again, i wasn&#x27;t an ahgase so idk if his real personality was &#x27;4d&#x27; and more feminine or if that was simply another idol persona he had). apparently he&#x27;s liked a lot by gay men (unsure if this is just in korea or in general) so either they don&#x27;t care about the traditional vibes he might give off or they don&#x27;t see it</p>
