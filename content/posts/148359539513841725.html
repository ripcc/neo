        <p>i searched and it looks like at school attack he kept blinking weirdly? basically cuz of chronic dry eye which i didnt know he had but it can get very serious i guess it makes sense that hes always using eyedrops. but like what does this have to do with wkn</p>

      <p>Yeqh basically chronic dry eyes where eye drops don&#x27;t do anything anymore, it&#x27;s so uncomfortable and even painful. My bro got Lasik and he regrets it so bad cuz dry eyes is one if the side effects. Rk also prob so busy ain&#x27;t getting no sleep plus always having to wear makeup so prob irritated him even more since japan. He said on pchat he went to the doctor yesterday so that&#x27;s good and idk riyangis mad saying wk1 won&#x27;t let him go to the doctor and shit. /+r/148353337379740815</p>

      <p>no like people actually commit suicide over those kinds of complications so i get the concern but of course it has to get mixed with unnecessary bullshit. his schedule and routine is def worsening it but its still concerning that he has to rely this heavily on drops at 20 but glad hes got it checked</p>
