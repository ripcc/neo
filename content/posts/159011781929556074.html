        <p>You can share or not share! I’m just typing this on break.
Hao is very outspoken about his feelings for hanbin. Crazy repos aside he singles Hanbin out every time even if the question is open ended or not about him (I ignore his crazy responses where he smirks lmao cause he obv playin there). Like he’s called Hanbin “my most important person in korea” “he’s the person I’m closest to that’s the biggest difference” “we’re closest so i expect and want more from him” “I couldn’t help but cry to him, I couldn’t cry to anyone else” “真正意义上的初恋” “my strong desire to debut was mostly because of him” only took Hanbin to eat with his mom during a busy schedule. And recently he said “when I’m unhappy, if I see him I feel better. If I don’t see him, I can’t” “only Hanbin controls me. No one else dares. Only he can”
So hao consistently over 2 years has put Hanbin on a pedestal from everyone else. And hao relies on Hanbin emotionally the most (kind of needy in a sense, which we saw when hao was whimpering to Hanbin at the beginning of hbs live).
Hanbin on the other hand talks sweetly about hao but hardly ever puts hao on a pedestal from everyone else. Weirdly enough Hanbin kinda does that with Gyuvin. Recently Hanbin was asked who he can be most honest and selfish with and chose Gyuvin and they’re always together. Hanbin use to call hao his soulmate and would talk about him more but now mainly talks about Gyuvin helping him emotionally. I know Hanbin loves hao but it’s less clear if hao is his closest person emotionally. Whether they’re dating or not is up to ppls perception but to me it’s been made clear that Hanbin is most important/closest to hao but it’s not as certain with Hanbin. Ppl can get upset with that but I’m going based off of words and actions.
Damn this was too long my bad 😭</p>

        <p>ngl im only replying to this since its rlly long i feel bad but in general i take repos as very surface level so who knows how deep any of this goes the contrast is interesting but it also makes you think ab the overall dynamic in the team zgh isnt as close to anyone as he is w hbn but hbn has larger variety. this not my thing tho so idk</p>

      <p>the advantage of language really exists ppl forget that also including personalities of the 2 but hbn fans are very big on duos and 2bnz happens to be very up there so I&#x27;m sure answers are catered to them if they&#x27;re asking. all in all repos have never been end all be all answers to looming questions they&#x27;re fun insights and very indulgent to who&#x27;s asking so idk there shouldn&#x27;t be mental gymnastics surrounding it. and I get we like to read between the lines when it comes to all forms of content but this is genuinely an old debate it&#x27;s not hard to understand 😭</p>
