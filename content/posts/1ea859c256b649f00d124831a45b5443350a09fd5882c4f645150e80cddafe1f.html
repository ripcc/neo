      <p>diff anon and I dont even wish this upon uncle ğŸ’€ like theres a difference between hating him online and physically sending wreaths wishing him death ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ but tbh I can see this being the new trucks because clearly trucks don&#x27;t do shit but sm switched up once the wreaths started stacking up</p>
