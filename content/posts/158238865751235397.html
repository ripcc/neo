        <p>For funzies I just Grok&#x27;d asdfkjdf;kasjdhfkjas dkm it&#x27;s actually useful if you&#x27;re lazy &#x27;what food is Shanghai known for&#x27; and first answer is Xiao Long Bao so if she mentions that FUCK IT IM JOINING TOO Oh gawd not the Chinese discourse again üíÄ I&#x27;m not her stan but I&#x27;m nosey so I&#x27;ve seen rumors saying her family is originally from Shandong? A bit north of Shanghai before going to Taiwan then to Korea and they left Taiwan before Taiwan became Taiwan if that makes sense so her family is technically still Chinese and not Taiwanese but her kfans say Taiwanese cause it&#x27;s better than being Chinese. Pan k gurlies always say her body proportion looks Northern Chinese small head long limbs like those douyin gurlies to say she&#x27;s Chinese but the funny thing is they say that to insult her but hey I&#x27;ll take that compliment üòÇ‚úåÔ∏è <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/157616171317943067" class="replyLink">/+r/157616171317943067</a></p>
