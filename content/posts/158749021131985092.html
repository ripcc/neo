        <p>the jaefriends video was lowkey boring to me lmao maybe it&#x27;s just the show and all the episodes are like this, this is the first episode i&#x27;ve watched so i wouldn&#x27;t know. hanbin was the most interesting and fun but as expected of when you put ricky and yujin on a variety show ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
