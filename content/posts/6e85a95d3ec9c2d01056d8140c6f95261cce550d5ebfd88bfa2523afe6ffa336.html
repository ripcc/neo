      <p>i&#x27;m ngl i didn&#x27;t even notice checkmate being that high bc i&#x27;m used to zb1 singing like that so yeah i guess that&#x27;s the image these producers/whoever&#x27;s in charge have of them but it does kinda suck bc since they&#x27;re working with a different team from their usual for this, you&#x27;d expect less of that &#x27;bias&#x27; for high parts since they&#x27;d probably be less familiar with the group? 😭😭😭😭😭</p>

      <p>if it was a regular zb1 release I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed either but I would&#x27;ve assumed an out of house production would be different but it wasn&#x27;t like... I think this is an actual thing they&#x27;re known for just cuz they can manage it 🤦‍♀️ may 2025 be lower ranges only IDCCCCCCCC</p>
