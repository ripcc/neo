      <p>not a shipper but in the zb1 insta live after mama i noticed a little something just cuz i relate. haobin was sittting far from eo hao looks low on energy throughout the whole live but right at the end you can see him smiling big while holding hands with hanbin i had to chuckle seeing that realtime during the live ðŸ˜­ iâ€™m an introvert like him and thats exactly how i acted in a similar setting years ago with friends and at-the-time-not-bf-yet so i do think hao likes hanbin in a romantic way /+r/767d0c026e</p>
