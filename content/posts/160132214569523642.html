        <p>the svt thailand stop comes to mind where good seats were bought by cfans when thai fans can also afford them and the8 needing to speak chinese because there are a lot of them in the pit which make him hated by thai fans /+r/160124910096830792</p>

      <p>yall maybe hallyu unban is the solution so kpop groups can actually have more than one stop in china thats not macau so cfans can leave everyone ALONE like i know this gonna come off bad but imagine them coming to my country and spoke in chinese instead of trying to converse in my local language i will actually crash out ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ /+r/160126700250947471</p>
