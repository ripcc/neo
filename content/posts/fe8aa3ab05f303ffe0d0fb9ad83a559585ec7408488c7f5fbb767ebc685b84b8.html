      <p>i think anon was talking about how taerae and hanbin were shown for the zb1 part and looking at all the other artists, they are all under wakeone (more specifically comparing to kepler where they only showed chaehyun). that does actually lead me to one of my observations as someone who is mostly on ig is that only hanbin and taerae ever get post consistently like almost after every one of their group schedules/events or even endorsements. like it&#x27;s so obvious and one of the many reasons whoever the f their social manager is needs to be fired cause you&#x27;re not helping the account grow by only allowing 1-2 people&#x27;s post. whoever the social media manager was during their debut era (i.e., the era we actually saw the boys post multiple times on twt) let&#x27;s bring them back</p>

      <p>Again their ig posts aren&#x27;t as managed as most people think those two just post the most on there cuz they probably like it idk it aligns with the current Twitter and plus chat activity I&#x27;ll speak for gunwook since I know him best but he&#x27;s not a frequent ig poster or at least not as frequent as those two because he usually posts his BEST on there and more often behind the scenes not always like the shtick of not being allowed to post is old insta is more of a sacred posty app anyways</p>
