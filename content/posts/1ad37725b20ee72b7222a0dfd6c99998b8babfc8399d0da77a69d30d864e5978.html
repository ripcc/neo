      <p>lmaooo ok I checked. it&#x27;s literally just because some gyuvin akgaes mocked crosins for bringing banners and slogans to the concerts and called it ugly so now some crosins are dragging gyuvin&#x27;s ass but it&#x27;s not that bad. I saw many normal posts under his tag and the usual big crosin accounts who always engage in fanwars haven&#x27;t said anything about it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge fanwar.</p>
