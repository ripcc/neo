      <p>This coming from another homo but a big reason why so many people donâ€™t fuck with park Hanbin is because he gives evil gay energy. Like not in a fun slay way, like genuinely one to be mean but also act overly friendly with people in public but lock eyes with you so you know they do have the capacity of being nice but actively choose not to be towards you. Other idols in this category: Key in like 2015 (heâ€™s grown out of it now), and Chanhee in a more subdued way (sometimes heâ€™s just rude af tho outright). I love my sisters but people can feel the mean girls energy from them. And no Iâ€™m not calling this just because theyâ€™re gay ðŸ™„ they just have that vibe. Other gay idols donâ€™t serve that, like Hao, Sunoo, that one TWS dude, Yves, etc.</p>
