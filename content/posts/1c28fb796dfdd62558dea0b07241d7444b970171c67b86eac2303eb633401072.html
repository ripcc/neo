      <p>Oo can you expand on what you mean? If they set a goal of 10000 sets that would be around 2.58 million yuan which is a bit less than his magazine sales so I get why they might have thought it was feasible I do think their social media strategy was a bit strange though especially the getting posts to have certain numbers part</p>
