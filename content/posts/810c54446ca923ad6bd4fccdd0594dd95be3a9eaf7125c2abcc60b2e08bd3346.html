      <p>i remember post-bp finale she posted a video somewhere and talked about meeting the members when the finale was over and the families were all together backstage and i think she mentioned that their mum said that she should be friends with jiwoong since they&#x27;re around the same age ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but yeah she actually only met hanbin during the finale so i don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re too close or anything, maybe they&#x27;d messaged each other before, though they were definitely aware of them being close friends. it&#x27;s cute how matthew&#x27;s mum/her have ddungjungham with them along with thewnini and that fox (?) plushie associated with him when they take pics at zb1 events <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/190">/190</a>c394313</p>
