      <p>their a&amp;r team is even shitty than ours. Like nobody is listening to itzy, stray kids, twice is washed, nmixx is very hit or miss they are very talented girls that try and make their music work but itâ€™s still very hit or miss. Day6 is doing well because they make their own music ðŸ¤£</p>
