        <p>Iâ€™ll start, do you gen think they are filming the mv in Bangkok. I feel like 5 days is way to long for the mv shoot and it would make sense if it was other content like a trip reality <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/139426367342334406" class="replyLink">/+r/139426367342334406</a></p>
