      <p>not to sound delusional but i find it funny when you can tell idols are doing a tiktok challenge after zb1 have like sometimes it could just be them partaking in a trend but other times i don&#x27;t knowwwww.... like i just saw park hanbin did a tiktok to igloo by kiss of life a few days after hanbin when i don&#x27;t really recall the dance challenge itself being a trend, it felt like it was just the song in general blowing up but maybe i missed something, and he also did that youngji tutting challenge right after hanbin when other idols weren&#x27;t (other than tws jihoon who yes does tutting but probably also got inspired since hanbin&#x27;s blew up lmao) ðŸ˜­</p>
