      <p>it annoys me when zeroses act like the entire groups gay but damns there&#x27;s rlly is a higher percentage of queers than most other bgs. obviously hao&#x27;s the only comfirmed but its easy to see the vision for hanbin and taerae and maybee matthew.
i feel like zb1&#x27;s fandom has more staying power than most other groups bc of the amount of fujos we have (and if zb1 was pernament, the akgae problem wouldnt be as bad as it is and the jw scandal would be forgotten some years down the road, so thered be a chance to win back the gp)</p>
