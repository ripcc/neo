      <p>So many kpop reactors are dickriders or straight up over exaggerate their reactions so fans can live through them vicariously and feel the same excitement they felt when they first watched or listened whatever song. But I do like kpop reactors that are actually honest about the music, production, mixing, etc. I also love when they aren&#x27;t only focused on the visuals (like reactors who make a music video reaction only about an idol&#x27;s abs instead of focusing even partly on the music). For this reason, I&#x27;m a fan of ReacttotheK (they are the nicest out of this list) but I also like Koko3op and kpx. If the music is ass or their vocals don&#x27;t sound good, Koko3op and kpx will call it out and it&#x27;s so refreshing. The fragility so many fans have towards music critiques is maddening so it&#x27;s nice to see people actually honest.  I also think (even if the reactors have had controversies or whatever) it&#x27;s nice to see an outside perspective of the music. Like, alright, you right, maybe Johnny&#x27;s lines in this nct song does distract from the flow of the music, etc. And maybe the production of the song is outdated and the synths sound cheap and detract from the momentum or intention.</p>
