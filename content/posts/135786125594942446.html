        <p>People found it ironic bc nbhungry also exposed someone else on their priv for talking shit like last weekðŸ˜­ Also she had like over 100 followers on her priv like damn idgaf about priv tweets or priv accounts being exposed but that&#x27;s actually a lot of people of course someone snitched I think what really screwed her over were big kneulbin accounts turning on her too they had some other issue with her but I didn&#x27;t read the post too closely <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/135770388239177298" class="replyLink">/+r/135770388239177298</a></p>

      <p>She sounded mad at both of them imo? but this post that includes a different issue too something about a neulbin cafe and artist compensation is what a lot of the bigger k nb accounts reposted I think someone was probably waiting to bring this up and did it when she got exposed <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/ffypk8/status/1876918337894068733?s=46"></a></blockquote> <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/135779138924665188" class="replyLink">/+r/135779138924665188</a></p>
