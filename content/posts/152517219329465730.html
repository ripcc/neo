        <p>taerae is like a bitter guy sometimes he thinks hes better than everyone else uk the type lf guys in high school who only got their few friends who think they are more intellectual or cool or whatever and everyone else is silly and laughing material üò≠üò≠ mb he reminds me of a guy i knowwww and i hated him idk whatever taerae is close to the old friends while he may have become close to zb1 its not that and gyuvin is like soooo different literally the opposite he&#x27;d be super clingy and gets attached and probably gets real upset when he doesn&#x27;t recieves the generosity he gives to ppl for example he went out with andteam k he was like &quot;ppl say that yeah lets meet later but they never actually do but k hyung did&quot; like in the lines of that he really wants the same back and taerae is just emotionally locked hes kinda &quot;yeah whatever&quot; type of a guy makes sense gyuvin and taerae fought it probably wasn&#x27;t physical but an argument happened and TRUST ME like fr on this taerae ignoreddd gv like hell, even on his birthday when gv was expecting gift like he gave it to taerae, but tr didn&#x27;t see that&#x27;s the type of a guy he is, ik he later might feel guilty and hence led to the makeup but i know guys like taerae and its ughhhhh HARD to be with them <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/9ddfb1abe012062178e5ea93dcf84a51761ce596761265cf714e6041b0a874ef" class="replyLink">/+r/9ddfb1abe012062178e5ea93dcf84a51761ce596761265cf714e6041b0a874ef</a></p>
