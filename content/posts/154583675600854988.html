        <p>What would zb1 do without these two 😭😭 Their content really fell off and you can notice Gunwook and Hb trying very hard to get the others to talk but the others literally dont give a fuck. Its all shortass answers. Yujin and Hao kill me with their constant •_• faces <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/153954640227162260">/153954640227162260</a></p>
