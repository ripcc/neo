        <p>the way people are already moving on to smnbgâ€¦i wonder if itâ€™s going to affect riice ðŸ¤” the way they are promoting the rookies reminds me of smrookie program they had for nct just casually revealing their huge male rookie roster while also giving people content</p>

      <p>100% they won&#x27;t sm is serious about their unknown trainee concept maybe only 2-3 of those guys will debut and it&#x27;ll be none of the foreign trainees esp that jj guy I think there&#x27;ll be 2 foreigners at best in the final group</p>
