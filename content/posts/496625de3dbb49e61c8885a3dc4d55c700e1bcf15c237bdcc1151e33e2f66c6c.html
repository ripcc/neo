      <p>Honestly we can blame Yuehua wakeone supadaumy fans or anyone else but honestly this would&#x27;ve been a bad look on anyone luckyz are not kids they can say no to the company a lot of other idols would&#x27;ve been hit a lot harder for doing this especially when there&#x27;s rumours about one of these fansites and there&#x27;s already allegations of you kekeing with saesaengs AND your group is getting dragged AND youve never attended any solo exhibitions like I&#x27;m sorry yes it&#x27;s obviously a Yuehua order it&#x27;s exactly what they were doing during bp but these boys are VERY RETARDED! Like not one person said uhhh idk about this omg Hao you may think being a rich idol is harder than being a student but you clearly lack common sense!! Everyone pitying them but if anything they&#x27;re lucky they&#x27;re not relevant enough for people to care omfg I love zb1 but they&#x27;re ac so retarded it&#x27;s insane between this and jiwoong tweaking out when his live was cancelled for political reasons like they&#x27;re all dumb as hell it&#x27;s crazy</p>
