        <p>Hey I was the one who asked. I just wanted an objective opinion and all popular Haobin neos shut down thanks to an asshole who spread our stuffâ€¦ someone couldnâ€™t keep it in and started spreading things about Haobin kept quietly in our space and sharing their neosâ€¦ now the rest of us are all kicked out because they canâ€™t trust anyone. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/147000845681251146" class="replyLink">/+r/147000845681251146</a></p>
