      <p>do you remember that account @/twobitnaz?? She was a raging allin akgae that would get ratioed every day (her name is now @/yeonsungz) anyway back in like august a rosin found an irl pic of her and posted it and allins immediately got the rosin suspended ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ not many people saw it cause they suprisingly got the account suspended very quickly, but i was able to save the pic lmao. But man that bitch is so ugly shes a fat white girl ðŸ’€ðŸ’€yet she would always talk shit about matthew &amp; gunwooks visuals</p>
