      <p>FYI to open a CBar or to be a member you need to show your account to the whole world and be a solo/akgae at the very least....nvm other groups (but generally not recommended) but if you are found out to be fw-ing another member of the same group you get hang drawn quartered like Cersei&#x27;s Shame shame shame segment..... Usually baseline is don&#x27;t attack the other members but sometimes it gets broken as well. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/152264533631784390" class="replyLink">/+r/152264533631784390</a></p>
