      <p>the liam payne shit is crazy bc he was posting on his snapchat story an hour or even less before the news got out and now those posts are gone from his story. saw that people on reddit are speculating they&#x27;re pre-planned because apparently one of the posts (mirror selfie with his gf) is from his gf&#x27;s instagram august 29th 2023. he seemed normal in the videos from what i remember, and with his gf, so did things really change that quick or are those scheduled posts too? and then there&#x27;s those alleged leaked pics of a tv smashed in the hotel room and drugs on a table üßê</p>

      <p>omo yea I just saw the mirror pic but it&#x27;s possible his label was trying to hold off the news and or the abuse shedding light as quickly as it did but yea those hotel pics were crazy... the guy had to be cracked up</p>
