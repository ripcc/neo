      <p>tbh i really like doctor doctor, it&#x27;s definitely already one of their best but i wish they left it as a promoted b-side alongside their title track like kill the romeo instead of promoting it as a pre-release the pre-release sweat to title track ftp promotion strategy was a no go 😭</p>

      <p>Nah this is what sweat should&#x27;ve had they need commotion before the actual cb they can&#x27;t keep going active then inactive they kill their momentum. Gsb was really saved by the new direction and the fact that kenzie produced it I think it&#x27;s good they gave this a chance and decided to do this imagine how mad we would&#x27;ve been otherwise. They&#x27;re not even promoting the Japanese song that much like wow I needed that ot9 live soooo bad the clips on the tl were enough to heal me</p>
