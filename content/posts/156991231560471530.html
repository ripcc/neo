        <p>so much of chinese is metaphorical and shippers actually don&#x27;t care about ruining their reputations they&#x27;re fucking psychopaths and I&#x27;m sick of people acting as if they are normal in any way shape or form they need to go to the mental hospital <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/156952013110992000" class="replyLink">/+r/156952013110992000</a></p>

        <p>bfnrncnnfn ok im a shipper too they can be lit sometimes but i think a lot of what strikes some jaobinners is subconsciously wanting to prove it since there&#x27;s so much push back so any context that points to smth more is ran with even in a case like this</p>

      <p>Diff anon I&#x27;m late to the haobin discourse party sorry queefy but as a chinese speaker I don&#x27;t think the term translates directly to pervert? üò≠ Or like even if shippers wanted to look at it in a more sexual context (which I don&#x27;t think hao was talking about but just saying if they wanted to) it doesn&#x27;t exactly mean pervert (which is a different word and sounds similar to byuntae btw) it&#x27;s slang for someone who&#x27;s more knowledgeable/experienced and can apply to several different contexts so I&#x27;m confused as to how the translator jumped to perv especially if they&#x27;re fluent in chinese <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/156957451298756152" class="replyLink">/+r/156957451298756152</a></p>
