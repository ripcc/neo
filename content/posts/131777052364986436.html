      <p>this ask is killing me because even during group promotions only those two were sent to variety gigs (+ gyuvin) ðŸ˜‚ like we&#x27;ve been lacking group promos for a WHILE i even saw some comments under that pann post anon sent about zb1 not being popular compared to other 5th gen groups saying they don&#x27;t promote well enough for the gp to know the members, and the disproportionality in schedules and the negative fandom atmosphere which is just sad because it&#x27;s so easy to promote the group but oh well <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/131762881036506346" class="replyLink">/+r/131762881036506346</a></p>
