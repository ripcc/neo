        <p>Idk how much has been shared but hbs company definitely have plans for him post zb1 and before anyone tries to start on a post cj group ðŸ˜­ no . like Iâ€™ve been watching how his management has been moving lately and something has definitely shifted because his own manager doesnâ€™t post anything about the group now when they used too. and sorry queef idk much about the situation with gw and thel1ve especially since even if they were interested in him they canâ€™t really do anything till zb1s contract run out and then theyâ€™d have to buy out his jellyfish contract</p>
