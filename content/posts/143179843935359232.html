      <p>are the &quot;chinese fans&quot; the voices in your head anon? Bbshdjdjejsjd this is killing me like this isn&#x27;t the first time he mentions wanting to be an idol in korea for a long time he&#x27;s been saying it since debut and everyone knows the overwhelming majority of his cfans want him to stay in korea too bc that&#x27;s what he wants and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re always cussing out wk1 for not giving him kr gigs like what r u even on about lmao /+r/143060146984277448</p>
