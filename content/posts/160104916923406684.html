      <p>unfortunately gwk is mostly srs at least i think so, you can tell the diff btwn when hes been deliberate and genuine hes the type of guy who wears his heart on his sleeve so either way disbandments gonna destroy him. similarly he has a very close relationship w his fans and its a similar strain to how he is w mtt (obviously not the same but u get the gist) and hes expressive and kinda naive? mtt knows how to play the fs game better and yea hes the more private one out of the two so stories come from gwk more but those zoomed in bts clips its always equally both of them. as for gyvjn i dont rlly pay attention but theyre kind of like blood to me in the way that their time with each other is their foundation so the close yet distant feel is there</p>
