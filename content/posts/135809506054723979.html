      <p>i saw that hb mentioned gunwook on his live. he was talking about how he could talk about anything with gunwook. last time they talked about the four folks that reigned over the world or some shit ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ nerds. im sure that talking to gunwook makes hanbin feel smart after spending time with gyuvin /+r/135787277153689425</p>
