      <p>Mind you fila fusion is a chn brand and yh has a lot of sway there and its owned by the parent company anta another chn brand and their leading gba has been wyb since 2021 like you bet yuehua had their hand in getting him it ðŸ˜­ also explains why they are posting about it on all their socials. Speaking of which did they ever post about Rickyâ€™s 2 ambassadorships ? /+r/158239969398444824</p>
