      <p>I apologize for the unpopular opinion. ðŸ˜ž If it comes across as rude, and I generally read the posts here but this is my first time commenting, I believe luckyz shippers, who are actually people who are fed up with haobin, project the narrative that yujin is so much in love with hao, but honestly speaking, I believe yujin is literally balanced with every member, it&#x27;s just that luckyz are more vocal. Here with Taerae : https://x.com/traelxve/status/1850856805196546225?t=lrT821t-VsIW-VXDip68rg&amp;s=19 Here with Gunwook it looks very natural tbh. https://x.com/ay_lafyuu/status/1853212803341197475?t=xGGGyCbVoKO0uehZY2ge1A&amp;s=19 https://x.com/yujin_ke/status/1853417783184478559?t=xyw3cqBXuZ4CHwmm6Zsozg&amp;s=19 Here with ricky : https://x.com/yuehuazip/status/1853389151804010663?t=0Fm28mYS87VktsA8gVLA3g&amp;s=19 You can skip the link but my point here is He is more natural with taerae and gunwook, ricky and Matthew too, I find yujin is just doing fanservice with hao because it doesn&#x27;t come out to be very natural. Rosins akagae apparently using those luckyz moments to hate on other member so they wanted to create or equivalent ship like 2binz out of luckyz ðŸ˜Ÿ</p>

      <p>gjfgbfndmnfdm i dont bite nobody comes off as unknowingly rude u do that on purpose ur okay and i agree yujin is definitely closer to gunwook and ricky than he is hao and has been getting a lottt closer with taerae since they became roommates they have a nice dynamic i think luckyz have always had a pretty mmm stagnant? relationship theyre never going to be the closest to each other or top 3 even but i think they did grow closer the hit of the duo is just the fact that theyre visuals with good synergy and theyre both very popular thats really it and people make up their own reasons to ship as for intl rosin akgaes theyre like suuuuper against shipping in general so they dont treat it as one they just beg the duo a lot kinda similar to allin akgaes the sentiment is a little less common but they just beg 2binz more as a duo</p>
