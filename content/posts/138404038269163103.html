        <p>Matthew stan here and ever since that other Matthew stan mentioned that they hate this one specific thing about Matthew I&#x27;ve been wondering if it&#x27;s the same as me... have they replied privately? I&#x27;m just so curious because there&#x27;s this one thing for me too and it&#x27;s driving me crazy but it&#x27;s such a big part of him and what makes him &#x27;him&#x27;... ugh should I just say it? I&#x27;m going to sound like an anti but it&#x27;s not true at all I love him to death but the Now or Never song just.... I hate his vocals. There. I don&#x27;t know what it is specifically because I&#x27;m no vocal expert but his tone? or just the way he sings is so irritating and makes their songs so unenjoyable to me and I hate myself for feelings that way because I love him so much but...</p>
