      <p>This may or may not be an unpopular opinion and no one has to agree but more and more lately I feel like if zb1 extend their contracts Iâ€™ll probably just drop the group. I love them so much and Iâ€™d like to be a person who says fandoms donâ€™t influence my stan experience but Iâ€™m not, at least not in the fandom ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like even the most basic things arenâ€™t enjoyable because thereâ€™s always people complaining and arguing about something. I also used to think that if they extended the akgaes would be so mad they left but looking at keplians, their akgaes mostly stayed so I donâ€™t have any hope there.</p>

      <p>I can&#x27;t lie a subconscious pro is that there&#x27;s an end even though it would make me suicidal but for me it&#x27;s not akgaes I just don&#x27;t like how low budget wakeone moves. these akgaes are honestly easy to tune out once you get to a certain point like damn they can keep trying to beat on people... WE DONT CARE ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘‹ but maybe the love is real and I&#x27;d stan for a lot longer</p>
