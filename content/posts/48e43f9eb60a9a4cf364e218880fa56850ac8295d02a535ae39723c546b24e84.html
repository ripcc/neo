      <p>Luckyz weren&#x27;t announced like this last year. We just knew because Yujin keeps dropping clues. Mnet didn&#x27;t even announce the opening acts and Hao opening the show was a shocking that I cried for 2 reasons. Out of happiness and regret that I didn&#x27;t get day 1mama. Fucking mnet. I think sales is low that they have to hype the opening acts. Last year was sold out for 2 days right?</p>
