        <p>boy group sales have inflated across the board, everybody&#x27;s sales are ballooning because of kpop waste culture. the only reason zb1 is breaking those records is because they&#x27;re the latest mnet boy group. wakeone didn&#x27;t do anything special with the and as a matter of fact hardly marketed them at all, which is why nobody knows them in korea. that&#x27;s the problem with bgs nowadays. it&#x27;s all artificially big sales numbers, no cultural relevance. zb1 is really just benefitting from CJ and mnet privilege <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/146292812944727384" class="replyLink">/+r/146292812944727384</a></p>
