      <p>wasn&#x27;t the shipper tweak on weibo aka a chinese platform? hao has addressed chinese fans and their concerns in chinese before (would&#x27;ve thought akgaes who allegedly only spend time focusing on one person would know this) so he definitely could&#x27;ve sent an apology in chinese. not saying they weren&#x27;t an issue but why are we erasing all parties that were involved when if you look at all factors of a situation /rationally/ then you can better address and attempt to solve a problem. also it&#x27;s kinda crazy how all akgaes talk the exact same with the same mental illness to top it off, very much cult vibes <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/0">/0</a>e37bbbc04</p>
