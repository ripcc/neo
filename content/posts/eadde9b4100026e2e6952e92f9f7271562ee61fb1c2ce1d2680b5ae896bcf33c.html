      <p>prob unpop opinion but for cookie the context was hidden like those children cartoons that make adult jokes and if you&#x27;re not older you wont get it so when you re watch it as an adult your like HEY WTFFF and that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s wrong because i doubt new jeans knew the actual meaning behind cookie. for yujiin he clearly likes the sexy concept I mean he been begging to do over me since forever, yes hes a minor but hes aware of whats hes doing and i think thats the difference and why for him its okay/ passable plus cultural difference, for us its weird but not over there</p>

      <p>No I agree there was a clear diff cookie had sexual connotations that just came off so weird and it&#x27;s obviously something they had no control but yea yujin on the other hand likes a mature concept that&#x27;s just how he is lmao</p>
