        <p>Why are riyangis now being shady to the other members (specifically gw and hb) for gw saying “he would have told him to take the jacket off” and then mad at hb when gw himself said he never got mad at Ricky. Now you got his fans victimising him saying he’s in a group with bullies 😭 these people either didn’t watch the video or are brain dead</p>
