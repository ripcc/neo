        <p>Hmmm I kind of agree with anon except that hao def has it worse I mean I only ever see him get heat for interacting with other members/idols who aren&#x27;t hanbin and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of stereotypes about gay men / homophobia but I never see the same energy with hanbin even though he interacts with many more people so yeah there&#x27;s definitely a noticable difference in how they&#x27;re treated by shippers, this can be noticed even with intl fans too every interaction hao has with a male idol has to have 37378228 analysis but of course you can&#x27;t deny that shippers will almost always have a bias and that&#x27;s just what shipping is i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily a bad thing but it becomes weird when you only care about one and think of the other as some tool for your fantasies <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/135788423863819333" class="replyLink">/+r/135788423863819333</a></p>

        <p>I&#x27;m ngl jaobins the topic I&#x27;m worst at it&#x27;s too complex and I just don&#x27;t keep up I can&#x27;t say why that is or where it&#x27;s coming from but from my perspective I just don&#x27;t see it happening to the point that it gets any worse than being unable to like them equally. But I will say maybe hbs job basically forcing interaction might be a reason idk</p>

      <p>i know you&#x27;re tired of this convo and so am i but &quot;i never see&quot; is such bullshit because that&#x27;s only your tl and your space for example i see more of hanbin getting dogged on much more for having so many idol friends and interactions with his mc gig and even shippers getting mad because he&#x27;s neglecting hao or some shit so they both got it bad let&#x27;s not turn it into the olympic oppressions over here based on your tl anon <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/135818167242151223" class="replyLink">/+r/135818167242151223</a></p>
