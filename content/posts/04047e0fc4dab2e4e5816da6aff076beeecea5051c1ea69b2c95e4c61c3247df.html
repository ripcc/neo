tbh if ricky had a ex gf it woulda been long exposed on weibo where crosins run it that&#x27;s sasaeng territory for exposing old dirt and rumor spreading. crosins and cris were fighting for the past week and still are so a bunch of old and new rumors were created on both sides but its all old stuff we already seen basically hao predebut stuff, kssing that guy on the cheek vs ricky airport &#x27;finger&#x27; motion, london female staff dating rumors, always on his phone compilation but no pchat so wakeone sns ban is bs and that ricky old group pic for gf rumors but shes his friends gf and obv fake text messages with no pics, ris buying uniskin/ katokato products just to take a ss for social media then refunding it etc. if anyone especially crosins knew any dirt it would&#x27;ve been out since last august during that 2 week ricky hate train and this past week but nothing plus noyb keeps fueling it by busting out the stats to prove rickys is more popular than hao on tiktok, ig etc ðŸ˜­ not just ricky but every members old dirt has already been leaked or exposed so if there&#x27;s nothing I think its safe to safe its because there was nothing</p>
