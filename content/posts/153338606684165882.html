      <p>Their spotify numbers ðŸ˜­ maybe iâ€™m coping but i feel like kpop engagement wise is at all time low right now i feel like once more well-known groups start having comebacks kpop might move again. Even lesserafimâ€™s comeback isnâ€™t making that much noise. H2hâ€™s debut underperformed (might change once promotions start) despite them having more attention and hype from being a big 4 group, their song isnâ€™t bad but it lacks replayability. Kiiikiii did okay i think starship did decent sending them out to locations and filming nice mvs, it def did capture some attention</p>
