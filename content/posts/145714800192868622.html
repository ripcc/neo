        <p>To this day im still wondering why zb1 didn&#x27;t do any of their comeback showcase with mnet I mean we can get a good content from it like their debut sc also the only original program they make for zb1 is camp zb1 and they keep re-airing that instead of come up with new show come to think of it mnet (m2) made a lot of original content for other idols for example got7 hard carry (this is only example no ill intention at all I swear) iirc they have 2 season, also weeekly, xg and many more. I know that they have zbtv and the trend now within idol agencies is to produce their own original content for their yt but I want moreeeðŸ˜« zb1 have great variety skills and we need to see that more no group live no variety program no nothing WHYYYY</p>

        <p>comeback shows with mnet are pretty rare and they take 10+ hours to film almost every idol who&#x27;s done it recommends not to so I&#x27;d honestly rather not because it&#x27;s not worth the con. as for the mnet stuff idk man they&#x27;re shit at content</p>

      <p>Are you kidding? iz*one&#x27;s comeback shows were some of their highest viewed videos and forced everyone subscribed to mnet to tune in to their comebacks it&#x27;s stupid not to do it <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/145685992114968886">/145685992114968886</a></p>
