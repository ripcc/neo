        <p>Random ask, I was curious about the jeju crash and apparently the black boxes that record data and mic didn&#x27;t record the last 4 minutes so wow... I don&#x27;t think anyone will know what really happened now</p>

        <p>huh? That&#x27;s really weird since the crash happened due to a landing failure cuz of a bird. And I saw another landing failure occurred on jeju air the next day I feel like it has more to do with the airline</p>
