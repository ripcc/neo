      <p>It is a undeniable fact most people just don&#x27;t care because Koreans aren&#x27;t cartoonishly racist
Imo the worst part was that bit about jyp and yg idols now being ugly because they&#x27;re fathers of daughters now and view women differently, the term they used against mx fans and them straight up using slurs against woongki, chanhee and Kevin because they are visibly gay like it is fucking crazy that they basically use words like bitch or the f slur in OFFICIAL documents</p>

      <p>That&#x27;s what I mean they would probably have reports on when hao was being outed not the malicious stuff about his ethnicity but I agree I think those were easily the most damaging they call on real danger to the people mentioned</p>
