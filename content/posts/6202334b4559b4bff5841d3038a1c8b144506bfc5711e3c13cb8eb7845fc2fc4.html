      <p>not to start queer discourse in your ns bc that&#x27;s not the point and it&#x27;s not completely serious but do bisexual men even fr exist.... like i think i remember someone, maybe a friend of yours, say that bisexual men just aren&#x27;t a thing in asia LMAO like i would just go with either straight or gay with all of them</p>

      <p>yea i remember that convo it happened a couple times its not that they literally do not exist but its harder to exist openly or in general as bisexual youd basically be put into a box whether its based off preference or whoever you explored with</p>
