      <p>Everyone keeps talking about how some idols look better in real life than in pictures. Can you tell me the idols (especially from zb1) who look better in pictures than in real life among the ones you saw yesterday. Also I expected Karina to look gorgeous in real life because then koreans wouldn&#x27;t be this crazy about her.</p>
