        <p>so you agree they push him where they can over the other members just because he got his foot in the door at debut (because they gave him the opportunity to get his foot in the door)? <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/145604543009479934" class="replyLink">/+r/145604543009479934</a></p>

      <p>it literally is the justification for all the schedules that came afterwards, obviously they pushed for him at debut so that they could put him at the forefront of individual schedules as a whole, why do people struggle to admit that <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/145609434171923328" class="replyLink">/+r/145609434171923328</a></p>

      <p>Erm his gig as the emca mc was never the justification this was all happening anyways and they put him at the forefront of individual schedules DAY 1 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ so no it was never a springboard he was already there.
