        <p>I&#x27;m watching risabae rn and I never watch his solo lives so I didn&#x27;t know Ricky was so soft spoken ðŸ˜­ He&#x27;s actually so adorable also checking instiz rn why do they call more defined? or pronounced facial features &#x27;arab&#x27; ðŸ˜­ Unless it&#x27;s a translation thing but it&#x27;s a positive comment I just found it funny</p>
