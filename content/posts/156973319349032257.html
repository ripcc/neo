      <p>not just the bp dynamic but hanbin saying they were like a married couple and confirming they share underwear in salon drip ðŸ˜­ like of course there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that but acting like hanbin doesn&#x27;t engage in fanservice is crazy especially because he could&#x27;ve said hao was like his brother from another mother or something like that but he chose to say married couple /+r/156969895836471450</p>
