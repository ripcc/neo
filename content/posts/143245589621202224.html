      <p>We have to understand that Weibo is a public platform exclusive for Chinese people unlike plus chat. And compared to IG that is available to everyone, including Koreans and Koreaboos. So going live in Weibo and speaking Korean is a bit weird. Who are you talking to exactly because even your fans don&#x27;t understand Korean? It&#x27;s like going to a Chinese restaurant ordering Korean cuisine &amp; as far as I know, foreigners can&#x27;t just do live streaming in weibo unless they applied. /+r/143189720510454756</p>
