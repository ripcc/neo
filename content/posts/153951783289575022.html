        <p>i was kinda holding my breath watching the dingo vid ngl ðŸ˜­ like its so easy to doubt everything when they have the worst fandoms across every board save for jfans ik zbwon have hella fans esp young ones but still everything ab them is so rocky the girls were actually singing along tho AWWWW THEY STILL GOT IT. like even here i get bombarded w asks ab their failure its fucking annoying</p>
