        <p>that anon who sent that ask about hanbin&#x27;s manager not posting about the group, you may be right, but at the same time, it could be that according to rosins, posting about the group means she is directly involved in making decisions about the group.  have no proof but am sure they harassed her every time she posted anything about the group. just yesterday i saw someone not sure whether it was a rosin or riyangi talking about how wk1 and cube stuff is shoving hanbin on our throats.  they really have a long list of people who are pushing him from cj, wk1, his manager to cube, i woulsn&#x27;t be surprised if they start saying even yuehua is pushing him</p>

      <p>Rosins were actually fucking disgustinf about this whole Ms song thing by saying she sleeps with hanbin even tho she has a husband and children. They harassed her instagram account. There is no way she or hanbin dont know what Rosins did /+r/153577720390046523</p>
