      <p>Sunoo is definitely gay bc he has a past, but the Enha fans don&#x27;t know that much about it bc it was kept secret (unlike zeroses who spread Hanbin and Hao whole life on every account). The thing is that his fans thinks that he is gay bc he is pouting and has those coochie eyes locked 24/7, which it&#x27;s what happened with Minseo. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/46ee7c927a" class="replyLink">/+r/46ee7c927a</a></p>
