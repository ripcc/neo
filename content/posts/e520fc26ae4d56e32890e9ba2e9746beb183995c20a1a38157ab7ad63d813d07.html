      <p>jennie&#x27;s song is flopping bad internationallyðŸ˜­ she should of come out w a western collab like rose. lisa has a strong fanbase in Thailand and sea countries in general who can carry spotify numbers. im honestly surprised w how well she&#x27;s been doing bc Koreans never liked her</p>

      <p>BECAUSE ITS ACTUAL SHITTTTTTT its catchy but that is not song dont careeeeee her issue is she prided herself on having a more mysterious image flaunting connections and being more of an icon than an artist like she&#x27;s probably more associated with fashion than music. Rose is so smart and I think she&#x27;ll end up the most successful she was always the most serious about music then comes Lisa&#x27;s who also has her bf but obviously she&#x27;s due more credit herself he just helps. I do wanna add that it&#x27;s probably easier for her to be a global artist than the other 3 because she&#x27;s Thai and that&#x27;s more palatable? To the western audience idk but yea and then jisoos shitty ass needs to choke she&#x27;s useless. I thought Koreans liked Jennie tho</p>
