      <p>Gunwook doesn&#x27;t have the right mindset to stay as a male idol. His talent doesn&#x27;t align with his mindset. As a singer or actor, yes. But as an idol? Bro literally said he got ambition but no greed. Sweet summer child you need at least a spoonful of greed to stay relevant. He is a business student he should&#x27;ve known each industry has different approach. Bro can&#x27;t stay playing a little happy family and rationalizing everything he got to the point his fans also catch the same disease. Lil bro signed into the wrong industry and geonppangdans did not help at all with them having mass good girl syndrome and saying yes to whatever comfort Gunwook gave them.</p>

      <p>okay youre saying this like anyone has the perfect mindset yes he could be more ambitious but he also has limitations. he has a crazy hate train and his careful rationale is what keeps it to a minimum like he used to show a lottt more but that got him nothing. hes not in control of anything so theres rlly no point and at least he released a solo song im sorry idc WE ARE KEEPING HIM IN THIS INDUSTRY!!!!!!! gpds have their plethora of issues but id rather the good girl syndrome over how other sfs act. yea he over rationalizes and it frustrates me cuz its like he puts everything before himself but realistically theres not a reverse</p>
