      <p>i snooped around and from what they are saying its that wakeone said yes to the schedule but then when it came to discussing details they started ignoring the mails from the chinese company. the ch company then contacted his cbar to ask whats going on. wakeone ignored them for 2 months and that company is still ready to work with hanbin. ngl but wakeone has to get their shit together. same with this japanese comeback, there is no promo from wakeones side. what are they doing thats more important than doing some promo for a comeback?? they shouldnt have accepted to take izna in if it was going to end up like this <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138201632361108621">/138201632361108621</a></p>
