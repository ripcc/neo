        <p>gdragon is probably snatching all our music show wins but I think theyre making a cb a t a good time tbh cause it was any earlier IVE would&#x27;ve stolen all their wins (+show champion and the show were off) and if it was any later than march kzrs would throw a fit and doing it in march would be horrible cause there&#x27;s 100 different releases</p>
