        <p>just found out the truth about ricky&#x27;s family and before everyone came to me, i knew his family was well off. but being in a family that owns superking sized national industrial enterprises? Dpmo, gtfo,stop being an idol and go home.
even if i have a hundred brothers to fight for i will still try to take the fortune, if you like the stage so much then perform at the year end party of the company your dad is the president of, imagine giving up everything to be a kpop idol, man thes rich kids really grow up with no sense, i can&#x27;t understand</p>
