      <p>idek whats there to lie ab cs since when yujin was a dozen he was a kid an needed to polish his vocals like anon be serious for once hes been always the dance prodigy gyuvin also  danced well they just didnâ€™t have the vocal coaches like see them now had they been dozens they wouldâ€™ve never improved now yujin has such a smooth deep voice and gyuvin can sing clearly and find the notes right, and in bp during the first audition both of them were so confident in their skills but by the next ep the mentors killed that confidence and did so for so many trainees poor yujin got sick too and they were all pressured ugh i feel bad now I remember that time, but honestly they never been dozens yes they were majorly voted for visuals but cant lie visuals r so imp like imagine someone ugly like we got jay or jongwoo or keita whos short u can say goodbye to the korean interests and i cant be having gunwook in a group like that mb ðŸ˜‚ /+r/131741808765131793</p>

      <p>I wouldn&#x27;t call them dozens now the terms overly used but during bp I definitely thought that but yes they&#x27;ve improved sooo much</p>
