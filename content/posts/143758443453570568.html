        <p><a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/143507844480850565" class="replyLink">/+r/143507844480850565</a> Lemme rephrase this. F4 fans especially kr ones mostly hate on gw. They are his biggest haters in kr (those lowlife who only worship visual they talk about face more than talent). There was an era around debut when gpds collectively having trust issue towards those who call F4 as F4 because majority are gw haters but some were trying to hide and delete the trace after the final. Thank goodness jp star creators are sane they love talented charming people, they are the main reason gw can debut (love you japan, maybe gw should try a career there). Also around debut era maknae line fans shading eo quite much. Gv fans are salty because ifans keep saying en garde is gw song despite gv being first onsite, yj fans are salty because inter potential fans wish gw is the maknae for the group to have someone worthy of golden maknae title, gw fans salty because f4 especially maknae line bias in kr and cn keep targeting gw because that was the only region they could get some protection and gw was weak specifically on those two region. Thank goodness hyung line fans win the toxic fans olympic or else the fight still continue til this day </p>

        <p>Yupppp they were a huge part of the people participating in his hate train back then it was them yhz fans and shanghaiz fans IT WAS JUST A DARK TERRIBLE TIME THINKING ABOUT IT MAKES MY TUMMY HURTTTTTT ðŸ˜– but exactly I can&#x27;t even explain how heightened everything was back then if you even uttered the word f4 you were getting shot on sight.. this was back when me and my friends were running around freely so intl gpds were a lot more proactive about gwk and stood on business and sis nah he&#x27;s not going to Japan where ill never see him again. Omg the maknae line wars were bad too I think I&#x27;m still blocked by hella gv yj fans on my old acc lol and ON GODDDD WE HATED THE FUCK OUT OF YJ HE RUINED OUR PLAN ðŸ˜­ but wow maknae line fans used to run shit predebut I miss it it was so much better back then</p>
