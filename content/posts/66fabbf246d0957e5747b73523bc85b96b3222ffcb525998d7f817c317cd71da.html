      <p>Omg that pissed me off also tws fans were defending hanjin like &quot;he confirmed he couldn&#x27;t play the violin in a fansign so stop blaming him&quot; well no one&#x27;s blaming him they&#x27;re just talking about the amount of marketing about this predebut obviously the marketing happened if his fans went and asked him if he could play even though literally nothing pointed towards him being a violinist ðŸ˜­ I also went back and looked at weibo and douban and there were so many posts about it last year some dragging hao into it, there were also viral jtwt posts planted too like this was a planned strategy and they did it on the k, c, and jsides I wish our fandom would fight back more ugh</p>
