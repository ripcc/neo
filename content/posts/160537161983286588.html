      <p>DECEMBER 2024 ðŸ˜­??? Oh sis I gotta hear your story about why you decided to stan and somehow got here I&#x27;m crying... December 2024... uhmmmmm yknow what yea it used to be better than this but not by a lot unfortunately ðŸ˜­. Most we&#x27;ve ever got was from 2023 to around mid 2024 but it was somewhat excusable because of the tour, but now they&#x27;re just being extremely lazy and unemployed for whatever reason. Ur miskeen tho the beginning was a lotttt better than it is now the next group live might be... after they perform at the fancons it&#x27;s bleak sorry ðŸ˜­ I&#x27;m just astonished, but my biggest tip is to expect doom that&#x27;s when shit usually turns around any sign of hope is a dead mission. Just realized this means youve only ever experienced PURELY zepisodes no zbtv or zb1folder........... I rmbr i said 2025 would probably be modeled exactly 2024 in a negative tone since 2024 was shit but.. ITS ACTUALLY WORSE OMG I WISH IT WAS 2024 AGAIN TURN BACK TIME!!!!!!!!!</p>
