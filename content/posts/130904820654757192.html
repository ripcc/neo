      <p>But honestly while we can discuss the zb1 fall off and haw wakeone are dumb as fuck for letting the outside companies (it&#x27;s becoming more and more obvious that Yuehua has a crazy amount of power for zb1) meddle in the group and clearly making them push some things to lay the foundation for their future groups--which I find unclassy byw like yeah that&#x27;s what these groups are for but I feel previous produce groups were a lot less blatant about it an arguably even bigger fall off is riize because they really did violently wash us last year when wakeone fumbled the group but now where tf are they</p>
