      <p>i just listened to 10 seconds of the song to see what was up and as i thought it would be the song is slow and calm which makes complete sense to listen to before bed? i do that too, put on a very chill song or two before sleeping and usually the lyrics don&#x27;t matter like he&#x27;s not gonna be listening to sticker by nct before hitting the hay lmao <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138327852629317665">/138327852629317665</a></p>
