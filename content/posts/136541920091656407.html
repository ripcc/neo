        <p>I&#x27;m one of the newer ftp gpd/ zerose and recently during a fanfight with trashure they were doing the classic plastic surgery accusations one up and saw this with ricky I had to bookmark <a href="https://twitter.com/sqricat/status/1868885783375217148">https://twitter.com/sqricat/status/1868885783375217148</a> I get why people are skeptical and claim plastic surgery to hate on him cause he does look &#x27;sculpted&#x27; but he&#x27;s naturally sculpted and gorgeous 😭 Honestly at a glance I too thought he got a nose job but that nose bump and purple hoodie where u see his side profile when he was young it&#x27;s always been tall and pointy. The driver license pic of him idk 16? in LA to 20 is also a good comparison because everything is the same. People need to hop of his dick 😭 because the plastic surgery agenda with him is so forced if you actually look at his predebut stuff and screams insecurity. Also people forget he&#x27;s chinese and a lot of chinese faces are more sculpted so lowkey some racism because in their minds they think asians can only have flat features :S <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/135775162237931811">/135775162237931811</a></p>

      <p>gonna side track a bit but anon brought up a good point at the end, its so funny cuz kpop stans claim idols are basically plastic surgery cookie cutter face replicas but finally we got someone who looks distinctively different and is natural but they scream plastic surgery 😭 cant win <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/135815603419307540">/135815603419307540</a></p>
