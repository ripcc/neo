If the MCs and some members hadn&#x27;t pushed themselves too hard, the atmosphere would have been so bad that it would have been impossible to continue. It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re doing badly because they&#x27;re rookies, but it&#x27;s like they were dragged out of a public place against their will. I was looking forward to seeing the members for the first time in a long time, but I was embarrassed the whole time. I think from next time, only the members who want to appear should appear‚Äù and then a kgpd qrt then mentioning hanbin and then it just tunred into burner accounts going back and forth and dying off into personal insults. Tbh I‚Äôm still not sure what the issue actually was, no one on the I side said anything even the akgaes so I guess it‚Äôs died over there now. </p>

        <p>Wait so are they saying some of the members made the atmosphere bad? I&#x27;ve only seen clips and aside from myngj dick riding the extrovert members made it fun so I don&#x27;t get it are they blaming gwk and tartar im assuming cuz their fans jumped in üò≠ I hate only seeing the aftermath cuz that&#x27;s what I saw but yea probably an in the moment thing you&#x27;d have to understand. I saw one and only one alln akgae hop in and they were just calling zbwon shitty actors so I&#x27;m not sure</p>

      <p>I guess it was mainly about the live being awk since the entire group wasn&#x27;t on the same energy and allins being annoying the rest spiraled into petty fights</p>
