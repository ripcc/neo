        <p>im not sure where this idea came from like i had one priv gpd mutual who raved ab this but she was standing alone in this GHFJDHGFJDSKFJGHFJDK ngl ss is wayyyy better than the current prospects but idk i just dont see it happening. ppl probably only like it cuz of ive and their popularity after izone but thats not gonna happen</p>
