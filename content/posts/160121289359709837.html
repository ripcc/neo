        <p>hope this doesnt come off weird but to add to anon a lot of sea fans can only afford those set prices and cant afford the inflated scalper tickets.... like yea hallyu ban but also when will that kpop group come back to their country its not fair to them too and queef is right because its always the same c groupies attending every stop so that adds to the annoyance like yall just gready atp ðŸ˜­ im surprised this issue hasnt been fixed yet like there should be some fast lane system for domestic fans <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160113246488187531">/160113246488187531</a></p>

      <p>Tbh not even just sea fans like the rare chance they add Europe and America stops to the tour it will probably be the only chance most of us ever get to see them perform because like 99% of us cannot afford hundreds to fly out to Asia to watch them perform <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/160118341510584167">/160118341510584167</a></p>
