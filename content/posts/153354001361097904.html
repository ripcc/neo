        <p>just checked spotify numbers again and usually whatever the promoted b-side is will have the 2nd highest streams but it&#x27;s out of love like i just know it&#x27;s rosins, they don&#x27;t play i fear..... i thought the other subfandoms would try but their numbers see more like what you&#x27;d usually see will a normal b-side omg allins and mulbokdans pick up spotify and get on your vpn if you have to rosins are about to wash you</p>
