      <p>Saw you guys talking about Ricky and it got me thinking because he&#x27;s so introverted, too introverted and tbh I was always curious why because I don&#x27;t think someone is born that way but rather developed through their environment so it lowkey makes sense if you think about his history. From what I know he went to a private kindergarten in shanghai then after a few years he transferred to an international school then I don&#x27;t know how many years passed he came to the states, he then went to Portola then transferred to OCSA then he came to Korea. Like he never really stayed in one place long enough or had time to establish a deep friendship so it makes sense why he&#x27;s so introverted and prefers to do things alone and don&#x27;t have many close friends.</p>

      <p>He&#x27;s introverted in the way that he&#x27;s an observer and doesn&#x27;t talk too much I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s super shy but yea it&#x27;s a product of environment thing if he had the chance to root himself somewhere maybe he&#x27;d more talkative or smth but he&#x27;s pretty good he&#x27;s not shy he&#x27;s confident and head strong</p>
