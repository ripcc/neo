      <p>wonys k and c fans are pissed af right now because for the past 2 weeks theyve been publicly tweaking at starship for not giving her any schedules that&#x27;s not brand or mc related, how starship isnt capitalizing on her natural virality like with the wonyoung turn/ spin and luckyvicky thing and to shut them up all of a sudden starship sends her to this nugu gamer event to give her a &#x27;schedule&#x27; but its backfiring because its so obvious why they suddenly gave her that schedule when she has never mentioned gaming once</p>
