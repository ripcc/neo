      <p>you’re right, sm has always done paypal.. like, just recently riize we’re mediaplayed  as a million seller when it actually was sajaegi? zb1 were the million seller rookies alone. they push their groups as if they are popular till the public believe they are really popular and starts checking them out. every sm group has tons of subtle articles pushing them, they pay influencers to ention them like they are impressed, and they shove them down kpop fans throats everywhere. /+r/160537303268413622</p>
