        <p>Whenever Ricky does lives and says stuff that is supposed to be flirty it makes me cringe so bad 😬 you can tell he don’t even believe it and it feels like there’s a gun pointed to his head. He doesn’t like going live and it’s 100% clear but his delulu fans will swear wakeone doesn’t allow him ever. Yeah the company is shitty and has actually done crappy things to him but lives is not one of them frfr</p>
