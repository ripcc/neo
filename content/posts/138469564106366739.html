        <p>someone said ytd that it&#x27;s probably for 2d1n filming (is it you who said this or anon, req i forgot), i kinda agree bc on the last episode they&#x27;re talking about filming overseas in ricky&#x27;s house in LA, but ig it&#x27;s too far and expensive so they just stick in asia <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138406525889896308" class="replyLink">/+r/138406525889896308</a></p>
