      <p>my way is honestly luck + trial and error I just go through friends of the members pages but I&#x27;m sure someone else could give tips. I&#x27;ve heard trying trainee friends is good I&#x27;ve never tried that and one of my friends found bangchan through some staff as well though I don&#x27;t think any zbwon members would follow staff except maybe that chill manager and maybe choreographers. You could try asking through kbnbists like that anon said a couple days ago</p>
