      <p>it’s definitely going to have the same formatting as produce/planet which was already perfect. They might just take away the k/g concept. I’m going to be sick because people will tune in 😵‍💫 the formatting and structure for produce really is unmatched. Boys planet revived mnet survival shows and this is how they repay them</p>
