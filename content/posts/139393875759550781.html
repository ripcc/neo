      <p>Am a new fan, I noticed that in the recent comeback, Hao mentioned having fewer lines. But what&#x27;s confusing is that in every comeback, fans of each member complain that their bias has fewer lines. So, who is actually getting more lines if everyone is complaining btw who get nore lines in every song</p>
