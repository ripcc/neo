      <p>https://x.com/shimrick__/status/1866480303193428279?s=46 &quot;i can TRY to love worm&quot; &quot;NEVER doubt rickys love...&quot; are they hearing themselves ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he even said i can TRY to love worm not i WILL love worm or anything similiar. riyangis are taking this whole thing waay too far by unknowingly shading ricky on some tweets. i saw one that said &quot;rickys brain is not that of a goldfishes, he wouldnt forget to go on plus chat&quot; ....who is going to tell them for real ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ they dont know but they are living in luxury rn. once zb1 disbands they wont hear ANYTHING come out of ricky even after he redebuts. yuehua cares less than wakeone when it comes to shit like that. with mnet plus chat, they (wakeone/cjnm) at least had to get ricky post a few things to get their app started, once his ass is on bubble.... ðŸ’€</p>
