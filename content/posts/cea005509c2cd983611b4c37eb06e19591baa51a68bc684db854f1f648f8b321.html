      <p>depends how they&#x27;re raised and the environment they&#x27;re brought up in. If their parents are stuck up and raised around other stuck up kids their age they&#x27;re bound to be stuck up too because that&#x27;s just their environment and &#x27;normal&#x27; to them but you can easily tell who&#x27;s brought up right and who&#x27;s kept in a circle /+r/71b259f896</p>
