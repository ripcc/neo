If their parents are stuck up and raised around other stuck up kids their age they&#x27;re bound to be stuck up too because that&#x27;s just their environment and &#x27;normal&#x27; to them but you can easily tell who&#x27;s brought up right and who&#x27;s kept in a circle <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/71">/71</a>b259f896</p>
