        <p>I&#x27;m one of the newer ftp gpd/ zerose and recently during a fanfight with trashure they were doing the classic plastic surgery accusations one up and saw this with ricky I had to bookmark <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/sqricat/status/1868885783375217148"></a></blockquote> I get why people are skeptical and claim plastic surgery to hate on him cause he does look &#x27;sculpted&#x27; but he&#x27;s naturally sculpted and gorgeous ðŸ˜­ Honestly at a glance I too thought he got a nose job but that nose bump and purple hoodie where u see his side profile when he was young it&#x27;s always been tall and pointy. The driver license pic of him idk 16? in LA to 20 is also a good comparison because everything is the same. People need to hop of his dick ðŸ˜­ because the plastic surgery agenda with him is so forced if you actually look at his predebut stuff and screams insecurity. Also people forget he&#x27;s chinese and a lot of chinese faces are more sculpted so lowkey some racism because in their minds they think asians can only have flat features :S <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/135775162237931811" class="replyLink">/+r/135775162237931811</a></p>
