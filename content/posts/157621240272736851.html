        <p>anon probably means that if yuehua is making tempest release chinese versions of their songs, they&#x27;ll probably make yuehuaz (if they redebut together) do the same and promote them more in china as a group. they already have members who are popular in china and if the rumors about china lifting the kpop ban are true, then yuehua will def milk all of them for all they&#x27;re worth in china as well and won&#x27;t have to limit themselves to promoting the chinese members only. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/157515850977599105">/157515850977599105</a></p>
