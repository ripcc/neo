      <p>For me personally I heard a rumour about Ricky&#x27;s alleged ex gf that I wanted to confirm and since I was on that krosins priv I could build a &quot;friendship&quot; more easily but usually kaccs have dms open or a spinspin so if you know a little Korean you can try to ask for things or even their priv and from then on if you know one person who knows things you can find like 5 more, that crosin isn&#x27;t really the &quot;right person&quot; she&#x27;s crazy lmao but I knew she had some yhz tea from things she would post on weibo so that&#x27;s why I contacted her but 99% of these fans are crazy so you really have to find like 3 stable sources and only outsource to double/triple check sometimes</p>
