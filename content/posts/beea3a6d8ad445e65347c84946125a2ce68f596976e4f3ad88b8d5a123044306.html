      <p>the &quot;new&quot; gyurae interaction was filmed when they still had their gsb hair colors meaning it was in summer ðŸ˜­ there&#x27;s no reunion in sight yesterday they were literally sitting next to each other at the award show and didn&#x27;t even look at each other once ðŸ˜­ i wonder what happened like it&#x27;s so bad they can&#x27;t even acknowledge each other&#x27;s existence</p>
