      <p>right the songs are good the issue is the lineups I was gonna say it feels like they were chosen off chance but they make sense in a weird way. out of love being the obvious kfan pick with jwg and hao and gyv.. yea wakeone def did that the step back unit and song choice are just smart overall and giving hbtrmt a challenging concept is better than giving it to out of love</p>
