        <p>I&#x27;m ngl I was so confused why I keep getting this tweet linked to me and why it&#x27;s doing numbers LIKE WE ALL KNEW THIS ðŸ˜­?? I guess it&#x27;s not known since it&#x27;s been so long but they didn&#x27;t even have a proper choreographer till ftp they&#x27;d get the choreo through video get taught the basic moves and hbn did everything else forget a performance director we didn&#x27;t even have that ðŸ˜­ AND HIGHKEY STILL DONT cuz yea they keep switching</p>
