      <p>Atp daechinso should stop inviting guest if they will have the mc sitting beside each other like that and not to mention they also sit in the middle when it should be the guest that get the spotlight, hanbin and jaehyun often on their own world and put the guest in an awkward situation the kickflip episode is really ??? among the 3 mcs hanbin is the only hope but here we are I know they were joking around to make it fun but if it&#x27;s only the mc having fun then what&#x27;s the point?? (Thank you this is the only safe place for me to vent out)</p>
