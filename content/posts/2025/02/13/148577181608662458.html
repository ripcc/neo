      <p>exactly if the guests are gay too the whole premise of the show doesn’t work… the only thing that made me question if hb was invited was that the host used to follow him on ig predebut like he did with jw, so if hb was actually invited wk1 probably turned it down cause they would never associate hb (and zhg) with something explicitly gay /+r/148355677738458470</p>
