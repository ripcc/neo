      <p>gyuvins had the least translators from the very beginning like he only had virgomaples during bp and a couple duo translators its tough too cuz a ricky translator can get away with still being in the learning process with korean while gyuvin always uses weird slang and idioms that would require someone fluent /+r/144472215029765156</p>
