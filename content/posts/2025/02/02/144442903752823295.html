        <p>remember that one japan live like way back in 2023 I forgot who but it was a duo or trio live and the manager was just snoring in the background when they were supposed to monitoring them ASDLKFJAS;KDHFA;S hmm maybe for live the manager has to actually watch it incase they leak something on their phone, hotel address etc and for audio they can just listen while they do other shit /+r/144101475340211218</p>

        <p>HRJHTRBNJTHGBFNDKFJGHGFJDKD yea that makes a lot more sense and maybe they monitor over the phone for face lives its probably just more of a hassle</p>
