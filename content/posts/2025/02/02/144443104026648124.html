        <p>What is with ppsmz ignoring each other&#x27;s existence most of the year and then resorting to gross fanservice during Japan promotions? I mean jw is a sleazy man who is incapable of having normal, human interactions with anybody. But I expect better from mttw. Atleast make it more believable by having some basic interactions during the non jp months as well. They directly start humping each other the moment they are told to promote their ship.</p>
