        <p>the handjob part was proven fake by audio analysis. they did complain about ssgs and yelled at them to stop following their car and kang daniel also said ‚Äúwhen are we getting paid?‚Äù so there was stuff the gp criticized but they didn‚Äôt swear directly at fans the way uncle did ü§∑ they released an apology statement after and the next time they went to the airport all of them did a 90 degree bow at the reporters https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/86b2rv/the_digital_scientific_investigation_institute/ /+r/144473604275525941</p>
