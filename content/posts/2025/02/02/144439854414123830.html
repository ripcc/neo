      <p>i feel like some of the work the zb1 members are getting is tasteful and some isn&#x27;t. like please put the fillers away, most of y&#x27;all aren&#x27;t even pushing 30. but it&#x27;s crazy looking at debut/boys planet pictures of them and then seeing them now like woah. i can&#x27;t exactly pinpoint what changed but something did.</p>

      <p>whatever the older members get is some booboo but there&#x27;s a big difference in debut till now not all of it is work but their youth... their light... ITS BEEN DIMMED</p>
