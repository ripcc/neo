      <p>Finally watched rickys risabae collab and why do I wanna cry.... This is the most Korean comments I&#x27;ve seen in a while with any of our content out ratio-ing english comments like the fact that majority is in korean instead of english when he has one of the biggest intl fanbase in zb1 is what&#x27;s insane to me... FUCK YOU UNCLEEEEEEE ILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID... kgp literally never giving our group a chance as along as they see his face.... w.e I&#x27;m happy for ricky I hope he reads all the nice comments</p>
