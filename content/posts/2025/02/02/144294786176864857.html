        <p>I think I figured out a thing that rubs me the wrong way about jiwoong. all of zb1 does ship fanservice which is nothing new but the thing about jw is that he barely ever like has a normal interaction with any of the members? 99% of the time it&#x27;s ship fanservice and once you notice he only does it with the popular members too it&#x27;s ðŸ’€ though he recently started to do yaoi bait with matthew again after leaving him in the dust months ago idk I hope he can start having normal interactions soon</p>

        <p>well he doesn&#x27;t really care about the group and never has so normal interactions won&#x27;t suddenly start cuz it was never there ðŸ˜­ he only interacts with members who r convenient for him sorry he&#x27;s just so weird and now that I&#x27;ve been reminded that it&#x27;s been 1 year since his scandal plus everything else ab him and just how bastardly he is I really can&#x27;t ever warm up to this guy he can choke</p>

      <p>this is from someone that voted for jw during bp i dropped him. even his messages on bubble and plus chat are so cheesy and over-the-top that they feel oily and make me physically cringe /+r/144118386144796650</p>
