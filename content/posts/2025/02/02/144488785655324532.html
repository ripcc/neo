        <p>https://x.com/shbzen/status/1885904445785207158 As a solo allin, I&#x27;m not even pissed at this because no one here said anything bad about hanbin and even called him too nice. The allins getting mad at this are such hypocrites. They can hate on other zb1 members while liking any other man, but zeroses can&#x27;t hate on other groups.They can like bnd as much as they want but they can&#x27;t expect the same from others when even knetz have noticed this group being weird with zb1. And it is not a flex to say bnd only likes hanbin when these men are also probably not so nice behind hb&#x27;s back (especially when you remember the hybe report where they called zb1 synergy of ugliness)</p>
