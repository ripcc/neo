      <p>speaking of it being the 5th mini album now&#x27;s gotta be the time we get some member involvement idc if i sound like one of those dumb pretentious kpop stans who brag about writing credits and how self produced idols are better (bc i also disagree with that lmao) but like i&#x27;d love to see the members have some involvement whether that be lyric writing or like a little tinkle of the keys since they clearly do that in their private time and also get that money after all the shit they&#x27;re put through. mourning feel the pop gw version which reminds me of this theory i have.... i wonder if companies don&#x27;t let idols have writing credits on the title tracks bc then that means the idol getting a lot more money and some companies are just evil like that like i&#x27;m sure some of it could be that they have a clear vision of the title track so that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no member involvement (and this doesn&#x27;t even apply to all groups, i just notice that idols are more likely to contribute to the b-sides) but idk lmao just a lil theory i have, especially since i think gw&#x27;s ver was better than the released one, at least from what i could make out from the terrible stage audio quality ü§î /+r/144489182633614683</p>
