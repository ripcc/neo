      <p>Tbh I can’t rlly see hao willingly going back to china after disbandment. Maybe the rumor about him saving up to leave yuehua is true? He mentions something about being in Korea later on very recently these days https://x.com/haopics/status/1888261735146262899?s=46&amp;t=C8RIy2M7sCJa85_OSNqjaw</p>
