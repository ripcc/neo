      <p>https://x.com/meovvpics/status/1891700747718328735 i wonder if this means that she&#x27;ll take over sohee&#x27;s spot or if it&#x27;s truly just for this instance and they&#x27;re not thinking of a replacement mc at the moment. do u think she&#x27;s a good fit? i feel like i remember u mentioning meovv before so maybe ur familiar with her idk lol</p>

      <p>i think they might try her out and see the chemistry/response its possible she could replace sohee but i can see it continuing as just 2 thats how it was for a while anyways</p>
