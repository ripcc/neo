        <p>hanbin said he did a 4hr language class umm do you think that’s something wakeone offers or something they have to find on their own? honestly they don’t seem like a company that gives resources</p>

      <p>I think it’s actually outside of wk1 because i remember he used to go to a language teacher before bp and even gave the teacher a signed album after /+r/151040899579862728</p>
