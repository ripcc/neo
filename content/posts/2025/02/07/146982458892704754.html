      <p>she also used to be a yuehua trainee and apparently used to tweet about having crushes on female idols and gay shit on her stan twitter account before she was a trainee which reminds me of a certain someone who is now on the same cast like damn do they just not do background checks and social media scans in that company lmao. i wonder if they&#x27;re friends tho /+r/146314549933595520</p>
