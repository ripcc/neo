      <p>Koreans be calling anyone who don&#x27;t have makeup blender as head and flappy balloon body type as ugly, but still wonder why their creative industry is dying. Don&#x27;t even start with &#x27;look like SEA people&#x27; as an insult. Too bad japan is stuck with their oldies being stubborn about keeping their industry behind the paywall and regional contents. They have much bigger potential if only their creative industry is more accessible /+r/145736421880320830</p>
