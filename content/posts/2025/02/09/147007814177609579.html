        <p>you pulled this out of your ass anon bc joongang group (jtbc) and cj group are known to be broadcasting rivals they even had beef during produce x101 the only connection they probably have now is through tving but jtbc recently opened jtbc now which is its direct competitor /+r/146982992949237930</p>
