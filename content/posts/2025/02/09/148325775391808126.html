        <p>oh ok I didn&#x27;t get what anon was saying this entire time I was talking about arranging the song so it&#x27;s not as high meaning kenzie has more say and might not do that but yea their parts seem to be predetermined they go in the booth just to do their lines</p>

      <p>as for this comeback im pretty sure kenzie composed the song with the members in mind already since she already heard then in gsb. more likely, hanbin will be favored because he sounds like doyoung, her favorite son. then hao/gunwook since their tones are near to doyoung. i bet, she didn&#x27;t like taerae&#x27;s tone the way she tried to erase his voice by tuning it to sound like hao lmaoðŸ˜‚ /+r/147017850446634925</p>
