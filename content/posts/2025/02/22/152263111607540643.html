        <p>I forgot how when theyve been priv but i think one of the main reason was because of japan promos, japan ent are strict as fuck with copy right thats why we we never see shit on the timeline so now that it&#x27;s over maybe thats why they unpriv honestly love them they dedicated af and update right away /+r/151375372079028675</p>

        <p>it was right before the tour if I&#x27;m not mistaken so not rlly for Japan promos but her reasoning was that she uploads a lot of copyrighted content and has always been at risk for getting sniped so she&#x27;d rather not idk what the whole thing about removing priv ppl was tho LOL</p>
