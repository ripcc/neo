        <p>Feels like they were extra mad because hao was basically the star of the show ðŸ˜­ his kfans look down on him a lot because he&#x27;s not korean but they used his clips for the teaser, the thumbnail about fuckass durianjdjjd and most of non-fans are talking about him and how funny/charming he is so they probably harassed hanbin saying don&#x27;t ever go to a duo schedule with him again ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ /+r/153352633049111296</p>
