      <p>https://x.com/pocketzgallery/status/1895151498494918916 but what do idols do in this situation? they prob get calls every hour and cmiiw but there&#x27;s no point getting another number because its connected to ur id so ssgs can find that as well ðŸ’€ Hmm I&#x27;d probably get a second phone without a sim and use main phone as a hot spot for wifi and just use kakaotalk on second phone or something</p>

      <p>i used to know of ppl who could sim swap its crazy your number is getting found one way or another ðŸ˜­ having a trap or a digital number not connected to a company is the best course of action</p>
