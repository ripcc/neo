      <p>on a similar-ish note, i thought of this while watching the latest zepisode but i do just think about it every so often, but to me it&#x27;s soooooooo awkward how all the members will have clips of each other casually hanging out or talking with one another, being all playful, but i swear nearly every jiwoong clip will be him just on his own talking to the camera and it&#x27;ll just be some boring recap of whatever event they were at and how he loves zerose like omg don&#x27;t make it so obvious??????? he&#x27;s supposed to be an actor, can their filming team make him interact with the rest and pretend that he likes them so it doesn&#x27;t look so weird ðŸ˜­ and even then the clips of him with members have such a terribly uncomfortable atmosphere, like no fun no jokes, or will just consist of him yaoibaiting. the difference is just so stark /+r/153581471494526821</p>
