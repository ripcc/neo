      <p>today is zb1&#x27;s first comeback stage for blue but of course mnet, being a big company dick rider they are, had to make it about sohee&#x27;s mca retirement. he literally hasn&#x27;t been mcing since the beginning of february but of course his farewell party just had to be on the same day as zb1&#x27;s comeback stage ugh why is mnet trying to take away the spotlight from us</p>
