        <p>hmmmm too bad there aint no other sources of transportation that can mass move people from one place to another through vast distances quickly so they dont have to rely on planes.... hmm something like.... TRAINS 😭 HELLO WHY IS THE US GOV ALLERGIC TO TRAINS 😭😭😭😭 mini crash out incoming, ignore if u wanna 😭 during the whole tiktok ban/ xhs migration + China deepseek thing I went on a whole binge watch about China today and WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY SO ADVANCED??! Their train system is fucking insane like they got bullet trains going every fucking where now, there was this long distance train route comparison from like 2008 to 2022 and I wanna cry... in 2008 they had like 4 lines but now they got 100 or some shit https://files.catbox.moe/i5tbrm.png AND WE STILL HAVENT BUILT THAT FUCKIN CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT STARTED IN 2015? IDK BUT LIKE CHINA WOULDA BUILT THAT SHIT IN 1 YEAR 😭 We&#x27;re actually so behind in the transportation game compared to Asian and European countries like i can&#x27;t believe i have to drive just to get groceries.... /+r/152874701755211456</p>
