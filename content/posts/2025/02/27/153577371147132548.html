      <p>tbh i think hanbin’s calculate but not in a manipulative way or negative way. like he thinks things through and does 90% of the things he does and says on purpose, to me it’s more like he has an extremely solid idol persona that’s very different from his real self. I think he’s just and kind and genuine irl and not a bad person, but he’s def not perfect and super polite and patient all the time as he is on camera. I actually thought it was sweet that Hao said that because it means Hanbin is comfortable with him. Like on camera or to most people he’s “perfect” all the time, but to people like hao and ig to some extent gyuvin and maybe matthew he lets down is guard and isn’t always as perfect and smiley and can show his annoyance or grievances which i thought was sweet LOL</p>
