        <p>thinking about when taerae said in that melon chat thing that he&#x27;s been an action film star lately or something like that&#x27;s kindaaaaaa cohesive with these teasers since it fits the sci-fi vibe ????? please give us another cohesive concept. cinema paradise was pretty good in terms of that imo üôè</p>

        <p>hmmmm idk that&#x27;s throwing me off + the pics from that one girl. The concept feels like they&#x27;re going back to their roots and it&#x27;s apparently a direct continuation of cinpa I&#x27;ve seen theories of some musical/theatre concept which would make sense and include the action star bit like waitttt it could be cohesive if it ends being that</p>

      <p>The aesthetic reminds me of a movie that I will not name about a man who is searching for his wife who went missing on a trip in a fictional sea country (he actually killed her and is lying to the police) but it&#x27;s very romantic and cinematic with beach, tropical forest, and resort imagery and since they shot the mv in thailand, I think it will have a similar aesthetic - cinematic and focused on finding the love interest and adventuring through the landscape, the movie itself relies on some heavy exoticism of sea though /+r/144881413026699005</p>
