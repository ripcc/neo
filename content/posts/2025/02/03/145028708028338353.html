        <p>well if they keep releasing bullshit like heya and rebel heart no please do not be yourselves üôè nobody wants Ive to be fake deep or over conceptual, they got popular over catchy hooks and fun and easy dances. the one positive I would say about their flop era is that at least people can&#x27;t criticise them for doing the same thing again and again. /+r/144281834824621445</p>
