      <p>https://x.com/haofnoon/status/1892953034319397103?s=46 Im actually so pleasantly surprised about out of love, and I feel like this is kinda the music I was hoping for zb1 as a whole (reminds me of their run run cover). Step back and devil game are also so good and kinda funky, someone said devil game reminds them of exo lucky one and I can kinda see it, blue was nice but canâ€™t really tell since itâ€™s the same snippetâ€¦.ngl I donâ€™t think I really understand cruel, like it feels like itâ€™s a bit rock but also probably the most experimental out of all the tracks so feel like Iâ€™d have to listen to the full song to get it. Whatâ€™s ur ranking right now?</p>

      <p>OMG LUCKY ONE YESSSS THATS WHAT DEVIL GAME REMINDS ME OFFFF this is so crazy I was looping that song all summer hoping that&#x27;s what gsb would sound like ðŸ˜­ but wow they would&#x27;ve hit daebak if they came back with out of love instead of ftp ðŸ’” I was so sure of step back being hip hop but it&#x27;s so good and I love the funk UGH THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED. Blue has grown on me but I can&#x27;t shake the feeling of it not being a strong enough title but we move.. cruel is pop rock like I expected but someone already mentioned none of the songs hit the 3 minute mark except for blue soooo idk how these r gonna sound ðŸ˜… And I&#x27;d rank it like this probably Devils game Step back Out of love Blue DrDr Cruel</p>
