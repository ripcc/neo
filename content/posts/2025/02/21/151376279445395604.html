      <p>cfans indo fans and filo fans are the majority its the asians running zb1&#x27;s career ðŸ˜­ white ppl barely probably loudest esp on twt but like most of ppl ive seen on twt are filos and indos ðŸ˜­ and zb1 got the strongest hold on the japanese girls like crazy i still cant believe the now or never numbers ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i honestly thought it&#x27;d do worse than yura yura and they were losing the grip but it even broke that record and in a short time ! see asian fans are theeee best at longevity and stability in future careers, zb1 would still have a dedicated bunch later not as strong but itll be there /+r/151087840351179154</p>
