      <p>so what i&#x27;m getting from this whole thing is that gyuvin saying &quot;it&#x27;s louder than expected&quot; kinda rubbed some kzeroses the wrong way thinking he was implying that they don&#x27;t cheer loud enough in the usual settings (concerts, music shows), but gyuvin just thinks they are flops and that nobody knows them outside of the those environments and them getting a lot of cheers from the school crowd shocked him?</p>
