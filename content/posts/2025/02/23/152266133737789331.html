      <p>ngl I kinda was hoping for a tomboyz unit song bc they just kinda match energies....like looking at this tiktok they posted, they felt the most in sync and just as a trio I feel like they&#x27;d mesh well together esp. since they&#x27;ve worked together before https://x.com/kyoonghug/status/1893512456288243900</p>
