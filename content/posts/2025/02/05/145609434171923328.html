        <p>This reminds me. When mnet finds someone they love they will make sure everyone knows it. Their default mcs are somi, bogum and kang daniel. Even when they switched companies. They still kept using KD when he left and sued a CJ-related company. Hanbin is known for being good to staff and that&#x27;s how you secure future gigs. I also see that with mbc and gyuvin. There&#x27;s something there with gunwook but they seem to prefer gv.. /+r/145590484809767557</p>

      <p>so you agree they push him where they can over the other members just because he got his foot in the door at debut (because they gave him the opportunity to get his foot in the door)? /+r/145604543009479934</p>
