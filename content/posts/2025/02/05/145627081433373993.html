        <p>I don&#x27;t think them being newest or smallest has anything to do with it tbh. All the gigs he got he was extremely competent for e.g mc and atom was obviously going to him. more so that it being a first pick think its just his company working out things for him where they can, I doubt its like an actual pool of jobs and someone gets first dibs more that the agencies have to put in the actual work themselves to secure these things and some agencies are notorious for having shit management /+r/145609842504194318</p>

        <p>I mean in relation to cj there isn&#x27;t anything about thelive that would give them extra leeway and considering how yh has the most involvement with the group and is known to have great pull for the most part. Obviously there&#x27;s no first pick dibs but that&#x27;s exactly how everyone likes to make it sound most of hbns gigs do suit him and if there is a string pulled idky ppls first thought isn&#x27;t wkn ðŸ˜­ obv whatever his management specializes in he could get something from them like the bada show (he went on that right? I can&#x27;t rmbr ncndnsnsm) but everyone seems to omit wkn which annoys me they&#x27;re still handling everything</p>

      <p>Omg yes he went on the bada show which people actually count as a cj gig just because she was on swf ðŸ˜‚ which makes no sense because itâ€™s on her personal yt has nothing to do with cj and everything to do with the fact heâ€™s really close to her and sheâ€™s literally in his company /+r/145624613664282062</p>
