      <p>last night i dreamt that the blue mv was just taerae helping the rest of the members get back to reality and it was so repetitive and he was driving a car for half of the mv and i went on neospring to see what everyone was thinking and u + anons were crashing out bc gunwook had recently mentioned smth about wanting to do a driving? ğŸ˜­ concept or smth i dont rmbr so u guys felt like gunwook shouldâ€™ve been the protagonist instead and idk it was kinda funny like every response from u was a whole brick of text tweaking over how shitty the mv was and how gunwook deserves better ğŸ˜­ and it lowkey felt so real that when i woke up to actually watch the mv i was lowkey nervous it was gonna be exactly like how i dreamt LMFAOOOO</p>
