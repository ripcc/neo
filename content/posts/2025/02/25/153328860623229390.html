      <p>I love hao as the center of zb1 but these people often go too far like I beg a random pic on their group page of a behind of a schedule isnâ€™t going to erase his position. He doesnâ€™t need to be bang in the middle of every single pic or thing that zb1 does for people to know heâ€™s the center. Like Iâ€™ve never seen people take that word so literally ðŸ˜­ /+r/152837809122793922</p>
