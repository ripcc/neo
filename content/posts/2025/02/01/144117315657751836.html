        <p>This is gonna sound so mean of me but seeing what Chinese people said about Hao’s dog comment (I’ve seen that isn’t not a really positive comment at all 😭) it seems like Hao was saying anyone who is his fan is his baby… but any fan who thinks they’re his gf (gf stans) is a dog 😭 idt he meant any harm buttt I do think he was dissing them. Because he mentioned his fans which includes all fans of his but then specifically singled out gf stans and called anyone who thinks they’re his a gf a dog? That man is crazy af
He really said “I’m gay”</p>
