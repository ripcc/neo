      <p>right the thing about sm is they know how to get okay enough trainees that they can level up with time. obv their influence and resources is the main reason but look at aespa their so popular and loved rn when they weren&#x27;t at debut and they weren&#x27;t as pretty. They will voodoo these trainees and make people wanna watch 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️</p>
