        <p>https://neospring.org/+r/145697834119944767 honestly, it makes me wonder if zhg will actually have a better chance of negotiating better terms for himself (like staying in Korea more and doing like a balance btw china and Korea/international activities) because i think yh def has plans for him and will not want to let him go esp. if wyb ever decides to leave. i feel like zhg has a v strong vision for himself and is v individually strong and could do decently well for himself as a soloist. i also understand the sentiments of him in the new yh bg but he kinda just screams being a soloist and he does have a solo fanbase that goes hard for him</p>
