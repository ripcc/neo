        <p>does anyone know why they clocked it as multiple translators bcs i saw people say she missed the “들“ plural marker but gyv only said 제로즈를 and 제로즈가 in the krn msgs the 들 was for the “메세지” obviously she was gonna get whacked for being a gf stan and whatever she was or wasnt saying on other accs but people misreading krn and saying shes the one who fucked up 💀 anyways damn gyv needs to get more fans its embarrassing the only ppl translating r shimkongz and kongddakz accs literally poverty /+r/145213430478101644</p>
