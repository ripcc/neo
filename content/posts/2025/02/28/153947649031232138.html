        <p>only intl fans took that shit seriously kfans and cfans didn’t even care cuz they knew it was a random celebrity crush at 10 years old 🤦‍♀️ c akgaes were jumping him for haobin (as they always do) and kfans were made about the underwear + haobin. tbh it gets me mad when people say haobin play up the fanservice because realistically their solo fanbase which matters most fucking hate the ship, they have no reason to “act gay” on camera with each other because it doesn’t benefit them. most shippers were leave after disbandment and they 100% know that too which is why the catering to so fans is obvious. /+r/153340207834552296</p>
