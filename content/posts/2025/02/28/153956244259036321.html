        <p>on a similar-ish note, i thought of this while watching the latest zepisode but i do just think about it every so often, but to me it&#x27;s soooooooo awkward how all the members will have clips of each other casually hanging out or talking with one another, being all playful, but i swear nearly every jiwoong clip will be him just on his own talking to the camera and it&#x27;ll just be some boring recap of whatever event they were at and how he loves zerose like omg don&#x27;t make it so obvious??????? he&#x27;s supposed to be an actor, can their filming team make him interact with the rest and pretend that he likes them so it doesn&#x27;t look so weird ðŸ˜­ and even then the clips of him with members have such a terribly uncomfortable atmosphere, like no fun no jokes, or will just consist of him yaoibaiting. the difference is just so stark /+r/153581471494526821</p>

      <p>kinda unrelated but what pissed me off about his annoying auntie fans crashing out in that spotify vid was the members literally reassured him by saying how cute he was after &quot;making fun&quot; of him but when it was his turn to talk shit he literally just called taerae arrogant for giving dry replies and didn&#x27;t elaborate at all about it when all the members reassured about taerae being curt doesnt mean anything he just expresses himself different i didn&#x27;t find that part funny at all why would u call ur teammate arrogant on a public vid /+r/153910574907085049</p>
