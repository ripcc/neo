      <p>i translated the plus chat comments that op tweeted that were harassing with him and they&#x27;re going on about how other members care about fans more üò≠ is he still on that pretty, rich cfan preferential treatment wave????? otherwise this feels random bc to me he&#x27;s really not that bad with going live like he goes live pretty frequently and i remember there was a point in time where he was the only member who&#x27;d occasionally go live on instagram bc all the other members stuck to the paid platform like a bunch of broke bums who need that plus chat check omg. and on that note they need to bring back instagram lives /+r/148665202974611677</p>
