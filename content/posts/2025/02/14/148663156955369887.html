      <p>well that&#x27;s a scary thought now because i care ab yuehuaz family or anything but if he leaves that means hed be left without a management and worse that he&#x27;ll just leave totally ðŸ˜­ fuck cuz that means never seeing him again oh god, and if he continues with the industry he&#x27;d be alone its tougher ugh tbh all of zb1&#x27;s future looks bleak ðŸ˜­ yuehuaz being the &quot;ive&quot; of zb1 may or maynot be true leaning into maybe not, tho thinking ab gyv not being the same ab rk cuz he&#x27;s leaving yuehua is ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ if he&#x27;s leaving u should stick to him more idk mayeb we dont see it cs he was just saying on his live showing a scar on his leg saying he got it during playing tag with ricky and just saying rk kept apologizing theyr cute ðŸ˜­ but they&#x27;re all panicky ab the future WE GOT A GROUP OF TWEAKERS zb1 are just like their fans smh /+r/148581413053225984</p>
