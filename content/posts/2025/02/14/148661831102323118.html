      <p>what&#x27;s your favorite recent car design? i actually really like the toyota bz4x a lot, which is surprising because i was a vocal hater when it was first announced. seeing in person made me like it tho. another one is the ford raptor tbh i used to also hate that but i&#x27;ve been changing my opinion on trucks lately.
a car i hate so much is the new hyundai santa fe. i keep getting stuck behind people with the 2024/25 santa fe and it pisses me awf so bad like why does it look like that??? just gross. also for a 3 seater car i would&#x27;ve expected more than just a 4-cylinder engine, but then again maybe the less cylinders makes it easier to replace when the engine inevitably blows up. classic hyundai, build shitty ass cars. sorry this turned into a hyundai hate post. i just don&#x27;t like them.
also sorry for the whole blabbing about cars. honestly i want to hear your opinion on cars more than i want to hear your opinion on kpop. this isn&#x27;t even hate i just care more about cars tbh.</p>
