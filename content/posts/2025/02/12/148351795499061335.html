      <p>kfans in dc are mad that it is a refreshing concept again. Then what do they want? When will they stop with this complaining? it is just a concept photo, at least the pictures don&#x27;t look bad, and the styling looks good. There are other concept photos yet to come too. Why are they complaining already. And even if it is refreshing concept, why is it something to be mad about? Didn&#x27;t they want this when they released crush.</p>
