      <p>the current state of gunwook and his career has me really down icl, it’s feeling like in bloom all over again except this time there’s no unaddressed injury. all i want is just one pd or company to believe in him cuz i know he would exceed all expectations but that almost feels like a miracle at this point. i’m with him for the long haul, till whenever he decides he’s over it, but i can’t imagine him not developing some sort of resentment towards the situation he’s in, he’s really too kind-hearted.</p>

      <p>i have to disagree i dont think hell ever bear resentment towards the entertainment industry if he would it wouldve happened already. idk if its cuz im conditioned or i have less time to be schizophrenic but idk if i can say this is in bloom levels the era hasnt started yet so who knows what could come next for him hes speculated to join amazing saturday which im stoked for. and tbh i let the mc dream go a yr ago like gyv getting it still pissed me off but not cuz i still thought gwk had a chance like its clear theyre just playing with him mubank too. im not satisfied with what he has i want more still but were not in in bloom pits just yet were ok for now</p>
