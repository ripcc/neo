        <p>it wasnâ€™t myungjae centered ðŸ˜­ i watched daechinso and he wasnâ€™t involved much in the conversations his attention were mostly looking on the phone to read fans comments kinda hate him for doing that bcz when bnd came hanbin tried his best to involve every bnd member and show interest towards the group so the conversation feels more natural but jaehyun didnâ€™t even ask one question to zb1 and hanbin was doing all the talking it almost feels like he didnâ€™t really like the group /+r/140935025502933170</p>

        <p>From what it looked like I found it myungjae centered the members just beg it too hard but tolerance for him is at 0 so it&#x27;s gonna seem that way to me either way AND OFC HE WAS BEING A WEIRD UNGRATEFUL BASTARD</p>
