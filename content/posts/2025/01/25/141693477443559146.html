      <p>i honestly dont think ns is actually going away i rlly hope not its just a baby site like it went down for a couple days some months ago so this wasnt too bad. but if shit rlly hits the fan i guess it might be gameover literally none of the other ask sites are as good as neo rn ill probably go back to my old accts and figure shit out from there idk</p>
