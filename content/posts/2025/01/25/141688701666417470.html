      <p>i’m /gen confused if the tea is just “gw’s dating” with no evidence and nobody knows who she is except for her apparent nationality why does everyone believe it? or is there actually more damning evidence (you don’t have to tell me what it is) that yall can’t say /+r/140614107610174168</p>
