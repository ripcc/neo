      <p>Queef could you payola this. Zb1 are attending d awards mid feb and they have a really good chance of winning best bg popularity award. The voting is on upick and the gap is really small. The final is in 12 days so if everyone can collect jams daily we can give them another physical award ❤️ I also think they are the only bg in the top 10 who are actually attending and since the gap with first is small we can definitely do it if we put in the effort</p>
