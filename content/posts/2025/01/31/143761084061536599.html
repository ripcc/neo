        <p>mbc fancams were actually moving gradually and the fancams with the highest views are the ones mostly being talked about in instiz: karina hao sullyoon and a lil taesan so.. i mostly monitor views in the first 24 hours lmao but buying views are obvious when theres a huge jump in the views then it gets stuck i mostly notice it on yujin and hanbin like a huge 10k jump in matter of minutes sometimes matty and hao but this time i dont think there were ppl actually buying? /+r/143273867748792326</p>

      <p>yall will kill me for saying this but as i said i can see through that website how much could have been bought. another thing yall wont like zb1 is one of the groups where the fans buy the most views ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ im blaming it on the survival show nature /+r/143440760581347233</p>
