      <p>Any tldr on why he&#x27;s so liked there? /gen ðŸ˜­ I just know theqoo is one of the top Korean forum similar to reddit but I heard they&#x27;re really racist there and something about if you&#x27;re not from big 4 you barely trend so I&#x27;m just genuinely surprised he trends often if not the most out of the jebis on there /+r/143758646944421176</p>
