      <p>for doctor doctor i can see international fans liking it more, like i see a lot of non-fans already liking the snippet in the qrts. Don&#x27;t know about korean gp bc their music taste is so ass and they only glaze big4 groups but i see it doing the same as Sweat by pure kfandom work let&#x27;s just keep expectations low.</p>
