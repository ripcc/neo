      <p>wait ppl don&#x27;t like matt&#x27;s tone??? i wonder if its depending or different regions liking certain tones cs his is pretty popular in jp and others me personally matthew has one of my fav vocal tones in zb1 im a new stan since they went on zico seasons, and i was there mostly for haobin lmao not much into the group back then, but he caught my eye with the peaches cover it wasn&#x27;t too special or anything but his voice was really good and in run run he picked up after yujin verse that was soooooo good like woah all his covers he does on ps live and songs r good so i never had an issue with the tone maybe im used to such tones idk</p>
