        <p>i was wondering maybe bc it&#x27;s not an official schedule?? so they&#x27;re being told not to engage to the reporters that much /+r/138469652606179417</p>

        <p>uhhhh idk I mean this just reads as way too off but that could be it I don&#x27;t see why they wouldn&#x27;t interact with the reporters tho they&#x27;re always friendlt</p>

      <p>I doubt it, when they filmed camp zb1 and they flew to jeju they were interacting loads with the reporters /+r/138473094657563715</p>

      <p>right this is left field to how they usually are this is some RIIZE behavior but another anon said they&#x27;re probably exhausted from training all night which makes sense</p>
