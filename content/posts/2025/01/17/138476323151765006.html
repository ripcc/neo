      <p>Saying it for the rosin anon who things they are big and bad, saying your not insane and then proceeding to try and doxx someone over a kpop man is sever levels of insane and even if you did manage to do it successfully unless queef said something truly horrendous and hateful no one in her real life is going to gaf 😭😭 like you think her friends/ family / teachers / boss is going to care because she runs a kpop gossip page and occasionally called a member of a kpop group botched.</p>
