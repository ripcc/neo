      <p>Matt&#x27;s nasality is also hit or miss to me like others anons have said I change my mind depending on the song but another reason why people might be noticing it more or having stronger opinions either good or bad is that imo sometimes in recent songs he&#x27;s given parts where the bgm fades a bit or is less prominent which draws more attention to his tone and leads to more discussion and opinions on it (gsb bridge, now or never bridge, recent snippet) or at least I&#x27;m personally noticing it more?
