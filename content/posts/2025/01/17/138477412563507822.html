        <p>The only reason they&#x27;re saying he fits is because of their MC days and because she said she prefer &#x27;wolves&#x27; over &#x27;puppy&#x27; so those that ship them/ like them as a duo are saying she&#x27;s hinting at him because he was a wolf-vampire hydrid for for their darkmoon lore 💀 But that question has nothing to do with being a wolf itself, it&#x27;s a very common Korean speed date question to get a general idea of ones preferences quickly, it&#x27;s about physical facial features as in does she prefer soft/round features (puppy) or sharp/ strong features (wolf) and she said she likes stronger/ sharp features who&#x27;s also buff/ works out and he aint any of those imo, the only thing sharp is his hybe nose 🤦🏾‍♀️ no offence. I&#x27;m just tired of these shippers acting like wonyoung is begging for him especially tiktokers when she isn&#x27;t because they want her validation so bad yet responsible for so much of her hate. /+r/138405827592802736</p>
