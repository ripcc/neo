      <p>loved the singing parts but they were short and was it really necessary to add so much rap parts ðŸ˜­ i don&#x27;t like zb1 raps not exactly how i expected an rnb song to be but oh well /+r/139664037523970756</p>

      <p>I feel like it would&#x27;ve been perfect if this song had a bridge. at first I didn&#x27;t like the rap bits near the end either but yknow what it grew on me and I think it suits the song it gives it a fun edge</p>
