      <p>https://x.com/mamwangg/status/1881182717263659079 i&#x27;m DUN with this man fr this time who the fuck does he think he is. he just gave rosins a free pass to not only not support zb1, but to support got7 instead so zb1&#x27;s gonna flop even harder in comparison BITCH there&#x27;s still a whole fucking year left you&#x27;d think a grown ass man would have some loyalty to his own group and the members he supposedly loves but ok. i wonder what the members are thinking about this rn btw lol because if i was his group mate and i was talking about our comeback and how good the song was only for the centre of the group who&#x27;s already more popular than i ever will be to do this shit i&#x27;d set everyone on fire</p>
