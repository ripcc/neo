      <p>hao is insane. he knows how reactive and powerful his own fanbase is, and to say such inflammatory things on the live and then today talking about got7 comeback (after everything that happened) is so fucked up, he really doesn&#x27;t care about this group anymore and only cares about his akgaes who all just got proven right. i&#x27;m over it, hao is doing too fucking much and this insane catering to solo fans as opposed to his own members and group that he supposedly cares about and loves is crazy. i can&#x27;t keep stanning a group when their own centre and most popular member clearly hates the group too and is encouraging solos and praying on zb1&#x27;s downfall. i even defended him during that time he was vague about the apology, and all the other times he&#x27;s said shit that made rosins mass hate the other members but this is a level too far he&#x27;s ACTIVELY trying to sabotage his own group</p>
