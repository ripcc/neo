      <p>Hao kept saying to look forward to the song and even insisted that it was really good (the clip kinda went viral among non kfans, PR fairy fr) but pulled that shit yesterday bsjdidu I was surprised because wdym like he never said anything like that before i was kinda worried tbh 😭 but then the song itself is so short like whyyyy also idk if anyone thought of this yet but I&#x27;m assuming the &#x27;get used to it&#x27; is referring to the other songs in the upcoming album...watch the songs be short as fuck so automatically the lines are gonna get shorter. still he is so careless sometimes 🤦🏻‍♀️ I just knew people here gonna get angry at him so I avoided coming yesterday and just read it now lollll and ik you&#x27;re not reading his magazine interviews but he has been constantly saying he wants to sing more, even yesterday he said he wants to release a cover but waiting for confirmation so I think he is just frustrated overall.</p>

      <p>I&#x27;m assuming that as well either the songs are gonna be short or hes not first in smth and BFNDNNCMCMCN yea tbh good on you people went in but I get it hes ambitious but i just dont think it&#x27;s appropriate regardless if hes frustrated it comes with the job things dont always go how you want he needs to take some classes fr</p>
