      <p>Not related to Ricky but this reminded me of something that kills me ðŸ˜­ I&#x27;d have moots who police other moots if they rt a &quot;sasaeng&quot; fansite but then they be cross platforming xhs videos where those xhs girlies have their phone 5 feet away from the members face and it&#x27;s completely okay ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ If anything they&#x27;re the sasaengs at least the fansites are working ðŸ˜­ Them xhs girlies just there to stalk, mob and get as close as possible ðŸ˜­ /+r/142784707296450260</p>
