      <p>my take as someone not completely fluent in korean but learning. matthew is more fluent as in accent and flow wise when he talks but he doesn&#x27;t really understand more complex words whereas oddly for ricky it seems like he knows more complex words but have trouble forming sentences so he pauses more often and his sentences are shorter but I noticed his sentences being longer lately. /+r/143069701407461450</p>

      <p>I forget what it&#x27;s called but matt can&#x27;t learn the same as rky and zgh since he&#x27;s diaspora so that makes sense</p>
