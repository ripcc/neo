      <p>I think a Korean has answered this and they said hao is the best in terms of vocabulary grammar etc especially since he actually studied the language in textbook form, matthew has slightly better pronounciation in the sense that the other two speak like foreigners with an accent meanwhile he speaks like a learning Korean toddler, Ricky was placed last but I think he is getting a lot more in terms of vocabulary in comparison to matthew because he actually watched a lot of Korean shows meanwhile matthew is weabooing /+r/143069701407461450</p>

      <p>We&#x27;ve had the convo a couple times on here the conclusion was that since Matthew&#x27;s diaspora he has the natural advantage and since studying won&#x27;t work for him I guess the explains the vocab but yea I guess since zgh and rky can learn in a linear manner? they could be better</p>
