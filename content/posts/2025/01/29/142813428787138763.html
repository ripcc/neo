      <p>https://x.com/gyu_mango_puppy/status/1884230775413129318?s=46 Keplians in the qrts piss me off because it’s not like anything zb1 got at debut was extravagant and all of it was self funded like let’s not forget how much their 1st magazine pre debut sold. They weren’t using Keplers money for shit. This is different because this group has debuted and have consistently been treated better than zb1 despite zb1 pulling in like 95% of wakeones revenue. It’s funny when they try and put Kepler and zb1 on the same level at all when zb1 has been making millions since the first day and clearly we’re not using anyone else’s funds for anything</p>
