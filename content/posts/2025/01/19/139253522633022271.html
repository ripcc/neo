      <p>it&#x27;s true for sure i&#x27;ve always felt like they were outcasts when they have the same big (most of the times even bigger) numbers as big 4 groups, i hate the fact they aren&#x27;t acknowledged ☹️ they for sure have the biggest economic impact and these other groups are always copying them too 😭😭😭 i even saw shotaro and wonbin trying to do that filter meme during one of their lives that haobin went viral for i feel crazy sometimes /+r/139247778579829251</p>

      <p>No sis I hear you I feel like they&#x27;re looked down on for being from a survival show and debuting under a low midtier agency 😒 they&#x27;re a force to be reckoned with when it comes to stats but they&#x27;re never praised or acknowledged even when they had the ultimate buzz we only got a couple artists singing to in bloom and shit like wow I had to thank baekhyun for the first time in my life. also byun wooseok does tricks on the riice dick but zbwon have actually covered a song from his show AND performed with him on the stage but he ain&#x27;t say a damn thing about them like ughhhhh it&#x27;s unfair my meows they&#x27;re all alone</p>
