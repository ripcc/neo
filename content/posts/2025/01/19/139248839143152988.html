      <p>I don&#x27;t know if you keep up with the boyz but seeing gyuvin is like seeing younghoon all over again, the dedication they have with this chatting service deserves a standing ovation 👏 I&#x27;m not into tbz that deep to know about how&#x27;s their individual fandom like but I&#x27;m sure it will be hard for their partners with all these parasocial shits
