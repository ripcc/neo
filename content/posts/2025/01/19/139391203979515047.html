        <p>it&#x27;s true for sure i&#x27;ve always felt like they were outcasts when they have the same big (most of the times even bigger) numbers as big 4 groups, i hate the fact they aren&#x27;t acknowledged ☹️ they for sure have the biggest economic impact and these other groups are always copying them too 😭😭😭 i even saw shotaro and wonbin trying to do that filter meme during one of their lives that haobin went viral for i feel crazy sometimes /+r/139247778579829251</p>

        <p>No sis I hear you I feel like they&#x27;re looked down on for being from a survival show and debuting under a low midtier agency 😒 they&#x27;re a force to be reckoned with when it comes to stats but they&#x27;re never praised or acknowledged even when they had the ultimate buzz we only got a couple artists singing to in bloom and shit like wow I had to thank baekhyun for the first time in my life. also byun wooseok does tricks on the riice dick but zbwon have actually covered a song from his show AND performed with him on the stage but he ain&#x27;t say a damn thing about them like ughhhhh it&#x27;s unfair my meows they&#x27;re all alone</p>

      <p>why do we bring this convo back? reminds me of the AAA back in 2023 my poor children 😫 they’re definitely outcasts in the industry bcs nct wish and riize, bnd and tws got each others back being from the same company and not to mention their senior bgs from their respective companies are popular too so zb1 has no one not wanna one not x1 /+r/139253522633022271</p>
