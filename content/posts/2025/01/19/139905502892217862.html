      <p>Well being dramatic has always been the way of my cc/ns that&#x27;s just how we roll but you can&#x27;t blame people we have ptsd with prereleases and it was actually going good. no shade it was unnecessary and jarring and while we might say hbn did the same he rlly didn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t close and even if he did verbalize it saying youre not rocking with a song is different from complaining about lines to an audience of schizos as someone who has the most lines on average</p>
