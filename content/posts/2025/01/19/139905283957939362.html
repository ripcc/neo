      <p>i normally would clown them too but i looked through the other vids and their likes/views/comments ratio and it seems to be people clicking onto the video cause they are interested but then clicking out cause they are bored and not giving it a like. there are a few vids with 1 mil views that have less likes and comments than mattbins /+r/139433726378729395</p>
