        <p>i hope hao gets a two weeks media ban ğŸ˜¬ he cannot be for real. i did find it weird how he was more active on plus chat.. he probably got brainwashed into thinking he had the least amount of lines for every album and comeback cause there is no other way he is THAT greedy. just because you are the center and maybe main vocal does not give you the right of singing 50% of the song ğŸ’€ there are eight other members. somebody has to slap him back into reality cause he really just destroyed himself and his image with this live. throwing his members under the bus/getting them hate and complaining about having little lines ğŸ’€ just stfu next time. if i were hanbin and dating this guy, i would drop his ass</p>
