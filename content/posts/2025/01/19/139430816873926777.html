      <p>How do you guys determine of which member have the vibe to date a celebrity while this member with a non-celeb? Cause I&#x27;ve been in several fandoms somehow the member (esp the visual one) that I expected to date an idol consistently date a non-celeb</p>

      <p>its just a vibe its not a fact or anything like its not shocking that gyv would go for an idol i expected a small one just not THAT small and the members who give more down to earth vibes i peg as non celeb daters</p>
