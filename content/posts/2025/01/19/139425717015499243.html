      <p>Oh I remember, Ricky also said something similar. And Hanbin didn&#x27;t outright say he didn&#x27;t like it, he just said sweat was the one he likes. He was just acting &quot;ðŸ˜ƒ&quot; when asked about it and it doesn&#x27;t equal to whatever Hao&#x27;s doing now. He wasn&#x27;t bringing hate to other members or encourage his rabid fans /+r/139418941335492902</p>
