        <p>how tf chenle is comparable to hao djhfsj anon you clearly don&#x27;t know what they talk on those rosin gcs since this&#x27;s not a big crash out reason yet they don&#x27;t publicly mention it as much but most of them are very insecure about hao being gay and dating and still being near to hanbin even after disbandment cause they&#x27;re deluding themselves into thinking they will be over by then /+r/143443610363450674</p>

      <p>This conversation is so old and keeps going in circles I think I&#x27;ve seen it like 3 times on your neo already but even among c akgaes, I lurk on weibo and c-neospring equivalents and the ones that would crashout about him staying in korea are the specific brand of crazy that want him to be a c-actor or perform on cctv they want him to have a specific type of career in China, it&#x27;s not all about the ship it&#x27;s about their own aspirations for his futureðŸ˜­ Same applies to the other cfans who want him to stay in Korea and don&#x27;t crash out about these things instead they actually love it when he says he&#x27;ll stay in Korea, their career preference for him as a kpop idol is what&#x27;s driving that first and foremost before any other considerations /+r/143460227885519123</p>
