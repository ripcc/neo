        <p>ngl it was dumb and my tl hated her and her demonic friend group from bp cuz they hated gwk so we just ripped into her she slipped up by beefing my friend on her rps acc for saying gyvs hyper fixating on homosexuality BFNNDNFNDMFNFN then going on her main acc and talking ab shippers so she got gagged and went inactive i probably still have a screenshot or two ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ she was sparsely active after I just don&#x27;t think she cared to keep going but I wonder what happened to her buddy eighthdiary or whatever</p>

      <p>i thought eighthirtydiary was just her account for plus chat translations like i always thought that was her.. maybe i&#x27;m wrong tho. on the topic of translators that left i wonder what happened with juleosky, they were a hao translator who was also ot9, i remember them being good during debut days /+r/143459345122939775</p>
