        <p>the likes to views ratio makes it even worse ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i didnt even realise that. other artists have 5k likes and around 20k views... 7k likes for 70k views is ðŸ’€ btw karinas fandoms known for buying views too /+r/143260036951660712</p>

      <p>mbc fancams were actually moving gradually and the fancams with the highest views are the ones mostly being talked about in instiz: karina hao sullyoon and a lil taesan so.. i mostly monitor views in the first 24 hours lmao but buying views are obvious when theres a huge jump in the views then it gets stuck i mostly notice it on yujin and hanbin like a huge 10k jump in matter of minutes sometimes matty and hao but this time i dont think there were ppl actually buying? /+r/143273867748792326</p>
