        <p>Lowkey he was doing a bit of both, maybe not so much near crush time but deffo pre debut - 1st fancom time because whenever they’d be in stage your always see him giving stage directions ect to members and they never had a performance director in sight. I wouldn’t say he had the full responsibilities of their performance director but it’s really clear wakeone was under prepared in many aspects to take on zb1 and really just used his back group to try and quickly fill a gap he shouldn’t have had to fill tbh /+r/142087040635460241</p>

        <p>I feel like that&#x27;s just standard perfecting no? But he was getting stacked they had maybe 5 employees during that era max everyone quit a week into in bloom and we were killing iurselves</p>

      <p>i&#x27;ve stanned other groups from mid-sized agencies and in their behind videos you can see the main dancer correcting choreography and organizing stage formations, i don&#x27;t think zeroses know this stuff is pretty common outside of the big 4. they weren&#x27;t leaders of their group though so of course that is more pressure on hanbin but even if they had a legit performance director from the start i still think he would&#x27;ve been pretty involved because of his dance background /+r/142092572914046732</p>
