      <p>He didn’t call himself it but people don’t know the difference between running the practice / refining the choreo and performance director so it was all kinda lumped together. Anyway I don’t think the outrage was about the role specifically but more at the general sentiment of why did wakeone have no staff for them at debut and have a member doing something they should have had hired staff for. Nothing new in terms of knowledge for here but suprisingly there are a lot of new zerose who don’t know how bleak debut era was /+r/142343526397730205</p>

      <p>yea i think this is just alarming information for anyone that wasnt there no staff.. extra responsibilities... OUUUIE IT WAS TURRIBLE but this just makes me think majority of the active fans are new zang like this might be the only place where its mostly old fans</p>
