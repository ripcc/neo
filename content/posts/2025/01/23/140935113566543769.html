        <p>wookie just lack of vocabulary i think, but his english is not that bad. actually, the funniest thing about gaeteolz dating rumor is while people got a really detail of everything about gyub gf and their dating spots, we only get &quot;wookie got a non japanese non korean gf, if my memory serves right she is a nugu idol but not really sure&quot;. people are not even sure if his gf is a nugu idol or not /+r/140679506620012089</p>

      <p>Yeahh the thing is for Gyuvins gf all the haobin ns knew about it so they could exchange infos prob because gyuvin lives with them so usually at least on the k-side Korean nb fans also get gyuvin tea for gunwook it seems like they&#x27;ve just heard he&#x27;s dating and that&#x27;s it and only haobinini (idk about how strong his source is but I do know he has some tea for sure) said that his gf is a foreigner so he&#x27;s our only source sadly I&#x27;m not brave enough to dm Korean accounts and ask for tea myself on her,,, hopefully they already broke up and also hopefully he&#x27;s not the alleged whore of the group /+r/140864955179292566</p>
