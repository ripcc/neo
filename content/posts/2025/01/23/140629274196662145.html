        <p>I genouinely don’t get why all these companies communicate about artist schedules with their fans as if they can book them or something is this normal in the Chinese entertainment spher? I can imagine this being a hassle with the management and the companies who are actually the only ones able to do sth about these schedules etc /+r/140324231740347709</p>

      <p>Anon did you read the screenshots. They didn’t book anything through the cbar, the cbar had no idea about the job and it was already booked and confirmed by wakeone, the only reason the cbar even knew about the job is because the organiser reached out to fanbase to get fans opinions /+r/140613790806004082</p>
