      <p>Kallins were the mussolini of kzerosetwt for a while in 2023 they&#x27;ve calmed down at some point I think the whole truck thing def helped ans got good pr especially since rosins became the bigger evil followed by the mulbokdans and the gyuvin trolls although I feel they&#x27;re kinda falling off too /+r/140940847712787586</p>
