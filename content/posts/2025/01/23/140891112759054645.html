        <p>is it bad that i feel so happy gunwook is unpopular in china because at least i got a place where i could buy his photocards for cheap and his merch won&#x27;t sold out until i got my paycheck? no offense i love collecting photocards but spending more than $10 for a single photocard never make any sense to me</p>
