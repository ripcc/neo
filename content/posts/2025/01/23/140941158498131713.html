        <p>I think it woulda been okayish without the contacts i hate them fucking contacts sm not just on him but on everyone and the yt video itself he might not look as &#x27;harsh&#x27; because the strong studio lighting might drown out a lot of it and it prob looked harsher in the tiktok cus it was normal lights so all the contour and shit stood out ughhhh im sad too anon im saad toooo but its a one time thing #trust /+r/140892346320639836</p>
