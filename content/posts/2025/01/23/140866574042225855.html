      <p>this person is implying that the company that approached hb&#x27;s cbar scammed them just based of their chats and with no evidence because they said the schedule is still not confirmed. But if the company wanted to scam them why would they ask them about fandom buying power and what are the fandoms preferences instead of scamming them of money. Also I saw a mca live broadcast review in korean talking something about &quot;wakeone hanbin saying he will be pictorial or wtv&quot; (I couldn&#x27;t understand, but it had the words wakeone hanbin and pictorial)... So they will probably accept it but it may get delayed. /+r/140693884845121438</p>
