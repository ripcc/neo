        <p>Bruh... I can&#x27;t even cap I BUSTED OUT LAUGHING SEEING THE PREVIEW VIDEO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 like there were tears in my eyes idky like it&#x27;s obviously not terrible but to me at least the before was much better idk if his skins prepped but he looked perfect already. His features are so strong he looks better with less yes but this makeup artist was playing in his face, I mean it&#x27;s very easy to get him to look overboard so I&#x27;ll give her some grace. Ik the concept was to make him look like the photo but she took him to cosplay landia. And yea it&#x27;s a one time thing you don&#x27;t gotta worry im pretty sure this is risabae she has a specific style and she does transformations all the time</p>

      <p>I think it woulda been okayish without the contacts i hate them fucking contacts sm not just on him but on everyone and the yt video itself he might not look as &#x27;harsh&#x27; because the strong studio lighting might drown out a lot of it and it prob looked harsher in the tiktok cus it was normal lights so all the contour and shit stood out ughhhh im sad too anon im saad toooo but its a one time thing #trust /+r/140892346320639836</p>
