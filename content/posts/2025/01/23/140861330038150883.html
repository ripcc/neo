        <p>Gunwook is not unpopular, most of his fans are just a bunch of prideful adults (and oldies) who feel ashamed if they didn&#x27;t achieve as much as him to the point they be eating those school projects or office work more than hyping him up, they be buying him all presents they could give or purchase anything he sell as a compensation for not hyping him. Or they are simply a lonely individual who found sexual relief from him but stay in hiding because his mom stans are scary (also annoying) af /+r/139391386377214065</p>
