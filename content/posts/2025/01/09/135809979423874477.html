        <p>im sorry but if they give yujin/gyuvin/ricky/jiwoong lines that are longer than 5 seconds üò™ these boys are not even singing live. i really hope that wk1 or whoever the producers are took that into account.. not to mention that yujin and gyuvin are weak AF vocalists. if i see yujins name above gunwooks on line distribution vids ITS ON SIGHT</p>
