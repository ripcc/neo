        <p>People found it ironic bc nbhungry also exposed someone else on their priv for talking shit like last weekðŸ˜­ Also she had like over 100 followers on her priv like damn idgaf about priv tweets or priv accounts being exposed but that&#x27;s actually a lot of people of course someone snitched I think what really screwed her over were big kneulbin accounts turning on her too they had some other issue with her but I didn&#x27;t read the post too closely /+r/135770388239177298</p>
