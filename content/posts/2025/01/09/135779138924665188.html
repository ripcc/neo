        <p>https://x.com/gomgominno/status/1876876134979084527?s=46 Ok Ik this account has gotten called out for other reasons but a haobinist tweaking on priv that another duo went to a duo exhibition isnâ€™t exactly shocking information ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like this fork found in kitchen ass tweet. Also unless priv tweets are genuinely something harmful or outright psychotic I never understand why people share priv tweets they could just ignore.  Like there are many shippers of many diffrent duos who probably act exactly the same on their priv accounts.</p>

      <p>People found it ironic bc nbhungry also exposed someone else on their priv for talking shit like last weekðŸ˜­ Also she had like over 100 followers on her priv like damn idgaf about priv tweets or priv accounts being exposed but that&#x27;s actually a lot of people of course someone snitched I think what really screwed her over were big kneulbin accounts turning on her too they had some other issue with her but I didn&#x27;t read the post too closely /+r/135770388239177298</p>
