        <p>and here&#x27;s the chatgpt breakdown if you people don&#x27;t get it üò≠ Here‚Äôs an organized breakdown of your points: Bias Against Zhang Hao Unequal Promotion: Zhang Hao receives significantly less promotional attention compared to others, highlighting systemic bias. Nationality and Outing: His nationality and being outed are weaponized against him or fetishized by the fandom. Frustration with Fandom Narratives False Equivalence: The fandom portrays Zhang Hao‚Äôs struggles as similar to others‚Äô, ignoring the unique and disproportionate challenges he faces. This false equivalence undermines the severity of the issues he endures. Villainization of Rosins: Rosins are villainized for addressing these issues and accused of not caring about others. Their concerns are dismissed as obsessive or toxic instead of being taken seriously. Harmful Behavior in the Community Fetishization: Zhang Hao‚Äôs struggles are fetishized, not empathized with, turning his challenges into a spectacle rather than a call for support. Invasive Actions: The community supports or tolerates invasive behavior toward Zhang Hao while failing to reflect on how harmful and dismissive this is. Deflection and Justification: Instead of addressing their actions, the community justifies their behavior by labeling Rosins as ‚Äúakgaes‚Äù (obsessive solo stans), which dismisses the legitimacy of their concerns. Double Standards Rosins vs. Allins: There is a clear double standard in how issues raised by Rosins and Allins are treated.
Concerns raised by Rosins hold more validity, as they address systemic bias and real harm, yet they are consistently undermined. Call-Out to Specific Individuals Requeefiem‚Äôs Role: You accuse Requeefiem of validating and encouraging problematic community behavior due to their personal biases. Request for Requeefiem to stop supporting harmful actions if they don‚Äôt understand the issues fully. Would you like to elaborate on any specific points or adjust the tone?</p>

        <p>this doesn&#x27;t come off intelligent why would you use chatgpt for the breakdown üò≠ extremely unnecessary, lame, and you&#x27;re basing the villainization off my page... cuz that&#x27;s such a great source of general consensus bruh just click off and come back another day</p>
