      <p>The thing that confuses me is that when Hao had a live from their kitchen it did look similar to the other members dorms but it does seem like they have their own flats from the fact that they leave schedules on their own and you don&#x27;t really see them interacting w the other members in lives but idk it&#x27;s confusing maybe their own flat in the same apt complex /+r/135766257537604825</p>

      <p>Yea that&#x27;s the conclusion I drew wkn def had 2 flats right on top of each other meant for the whole group and then zhgybn got their own so that everyone gets more space but it&#x27;s the same complex they all separate according to flatmates when they go home but it seems like they&#x27;re heading to the same place. Plus it would cause issues if they had a diff complex</p>
