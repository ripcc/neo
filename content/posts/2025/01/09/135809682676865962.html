        <p>Personal opinion but I can tolerate allins slightly more only because 99% of the irking shit they say is just stupid shit I can look over whereas rosins will deadass hive together to build a whole storyline and narrative that isnâ€™t true to justify why they feel like something is happening (key example new wakeonez) /+r/135777342344877819</p>

      <p>agree with anon. i think its also cause alot of rosins are just the worst types of people online on default because those people tend to go for &quot;centers&quot; &quot;fotg&quot; &quot;first rank&quot; &quot;most popular&quot; ones in the group. they genuinely believe that anything thats happening to hao is happening to them, anything being said about hao is being said about them... they are literally crazy. it doesnt help that most of them are not even adults/have a life outside of stanning. they also love to cosplay as a different race and have MULTIPLE twitter accounts. just the worst pool of people in one fandom /+r/135785524865750691</p>
