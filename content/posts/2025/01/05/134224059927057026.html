      <p>Ik it’s common practice but it irks tf outta me whenever the HYBE girlies/boys thank bang sihyuk during the award acceptance speeches. Like you’re thanking the dude that directed internal reports of just about every other group there that contain slurs, sasaeng information, rumors, mean af comments, etc. that they for sure know about. You’re thanking essentially their bullies right in front of them. This isn’t even a pro-new jeans thing cuz I think it’s a bit cringe when they thank min hee jin too, but like it’s a whole different level of weird when you have the direct victims of him spanning basically the whole industry and there you are, ass kissing him on stage in front of their faces. How bad would it be to just talk about your fans and creative team instead and “forget” to thank him?? Lots of groups do that with their company.</p>

      <p>continuously thanking the man that was set out to ruin so many groups ruined your own reception and more is definitely a choice I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re being urged to but it also feels like they&#x27;re doing it out of their own choice I CANT FUCK W THEMMMMM</p>
