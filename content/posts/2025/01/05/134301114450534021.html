      <p>there&#x27;s this one thing about matthew that irks me so bad I can&#x27;t tell what it is here but I think he&#x27;s unaware that the thing he did might turn off his fans (it&#x27;s not about his personality, skills or cringe tiktoks) whenever he does it I almost hate him lol ðŸ˜‘ but on a normal day I reallyyy like him he&#x27;s so sweet and nice that&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t unstan him #freeme</p>
