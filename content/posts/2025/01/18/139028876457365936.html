        <p>https://x.com/popbinz/status/1880200696194294205 She forgot all these groups are from hybe and sm. These koreans (not gp) only care about them, and will ignore zb1 even if they give them good songs. I hope wk1 resorts to some sajaegi and does a lot of promo this time. Or else this cb will be a failure too, the boys actually want to give us a gp hit song but it can only happen with good promo.</p>

        <p>oh our bad zbwon arent from a kpop giant should they kill themselves? ugh i hate these brand of solo fans who think their poorly veiled hate for the group is some life changing critique WE DONT GIVE A FUCKKKKK WHAT U GOTTA SAY AND THATS NOT THE CASE. but ur also ragging too much even big4 groups dont get gp attention its very unlikely and fandoms matter the most which zbwon have theyll be fine</p>

      <p>Honestly speaking, knetz tend to stick with the group with solid concepts like new jeans &amp; aespa. unfortunately for zb1, releasing crush when knetz were expecting inbloom&#x27;s sister contributed a lot in migration. Bnd, riize, tws and even nct wish are staying within their concept during debut. wk1 probably realized it late in the game so they went back to fresh concept again like ftp &amp; gsb. it was so sad but what can we do? we were not the ones managing zb1. even Jfans seemed to struggle because less people are streaming  now or never. They&#x27;re afraid that sales will be down too. I saw some blaming the song ðŸ˜­ /+r/138793794719142064</p>
