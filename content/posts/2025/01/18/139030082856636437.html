        <p>im ngl while u sometimes have a point about ricky maybe not wanting to go on pluschat/do certain tiktoks + i definitely don&#x27;t think sinophobia is the factor (or at least primary factor) in play + riyangis are indeed dumb af w the way they go about things, i think there is pretty ample evidence that he is treated exceptionally poorly under wk1 (recent example: dispatch post on weibo with only 8 members)</p>

        <p>I never once said rky doesn&#x27;t have real moments of mismanagement tho I&#x27;d always say every stupid complaint and act up by ryangis lessens the impact of things that actually matter like all the time ðŸ˜­ this is wkn issues are their second nature my point has always been that it&#x27;s less likely targeted and just an example of a poorly run company. Idk what this is all about but that does suck I&#x27;ve already got mention ab yh in my inbox but I woke up randomly and I&#x27;m bouncing so I&#x27;m not getting into that rn</p>

      <p>How is it not targeted if it&#x27;s him most of the time? lmao and dispatch is owned by cj so it very much is targeted everyone knows riyangis can be dumb but saying it&#x27;s not targeted is a crazy ass statement, sinophobia is a rampant issue in kpop companies and it&#x27;s getting worse just take a look at other popular groups who have chinese members they have almost the same problems if you don&#x27;t care that&#x27;s fine but stop watering down issues just because it doesn&#x27;t affect you or your bias tf /+r/138960892950961624</p>

      <p>What is him most of the time? Is he consistently being left out on dispatch weibo posts or smth and ofc Sinophobia is rampant in kpop the biggest thing is the lack of exposure to Korean media and that&#x27;s not even the topic of conversation rn. Cj owning dispatch doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s a direct link even if there was an agenda against Ricky the big company on top isn&#x27;t making boss calls to dispatch weibo to leave him out.
