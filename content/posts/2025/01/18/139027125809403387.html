      <p>for some reason his vocals use to never bother before while he was on boys planet but itâ€™s been so unbearable to listen to ever since they debuted imo they keep giving him parts that obviously make him sound extra nasally and the same goes for jiwoong and yujin i canâ€™t stand their vocal tones anymore i need them to stop giving them such lines they obvs canâ€™t fucking do it and it just sounds like shit /+r/138486237450425812</p>
