        <p>Bgs will never hit again with the gp. Zb1 were the one who revived their hype for a bit. Riize got lucky with their debut and hybe is manipulating the charts for their bgs. Jyp is debuting a nbg soon but they have zero hype. Anyways 4gen bgs have proved that you don&#x27;t need the korean gp to hit big and zb1 have probably the strongest kfandom among the 5gen after plave, they only get discredited because they&#x27;re under wk1. /+r/138793794719142064</p>

      <p>Crazy thing is everything was set up perfectly for a new bg to prosper zb1 had everything they needed to hit big but they fumbled, and then riize had every privilege possible and the road zb1 paved and they fumbled even harder😭 in the end tho zb1 might be the most stable and successful bg of this generation even with the payola bnd and yws do not have nearly the same amount of fans /+r/138800049894414087</p>
