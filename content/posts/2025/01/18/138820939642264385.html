      <p>I&#x27;ve been thinking this since that little tweak out too bcs who are we kidding he&#x27;s definitely in idols gcs or even has staffs number the only women in your phone are def not your mom and sister 😭😭😭most likely someone saw him or it spread through kzeroses gc and he freaked out but now if he ever gets exposed (probably won&#x27;t happen #inshallah) it&#x27;ll be even worse🤦‍♀️also yes in the k-side too they always talk about him going out alone /+r/138809782869119747</p>

      <p>he was obviously lying why he brought it up himself is beyond me 😭😭 nobody asked but it was probably cuz there was rumor already going around he better keep that phone on lock that would backfire sooooo bad</p>
