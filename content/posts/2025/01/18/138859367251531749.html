        <p>I&#x27;ve been thinking this since that little tweak out too bcs who are we kidding he&#x27;s definitely in idols gcs or even has staffs number the only women in your phone are def not your mom and sister 😭😭😭most likely someone saw him or it spread through kzeroses gc and he freaked out but now if he ever gets exposed (probably won&#x27;t happen #inshallah) it&#x27;ll be even worse🤦‍♀️also yes in the k-side too they always talk about him going out alone /+r/138809782869119747</p>

        <p>he was obviously lying why he brought it up himself is beyond me 😭😭 nobody asked but it was probably cuz there was rumor already going around he better keep that phone on lock that would backfire sooooo bad</p>

      <p>When this happened I realised you were right to say it was his guilt talking about the alcohol thing 😭😭 this guy definitely got found out and started stressing about it lmaoo but hes very careful and doesn&#x27;t make it obvious so I don&#x27;t think his fans will be too angry about it /+r/138820939642264385</p>

      <p>that&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;m sure of he was pushing it so hard for no reason he def had a past and yea he probably got triggered I just don&#x27;t think I can call him careful if his tea is out there but may he be protected</p>
