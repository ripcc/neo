        <p>Yeah I&#x27;m not well weeded in the cside yet I need to get to it but I just started dming Korean accounts asking them oh hey I know you know a lot about x is this rumour true as a conversation starter and a lot of them are down to exchange kkts to converse further you have to pretend to be Korean tho also some of the more batshit ones don&#x27;t gossip they&#x27;re like pay me to speak although that&#x27;s a bit more rare, kbnb fans are what I advise because the basis of exchanging tea for them is fangirling while for other fans they&#x27;re going to be more defensive because potential gfs smoking etc aren&#x27;t things they like and so they&#x27;re bitter but there&#x27;s still very nice solos and in the k-side specifically all the intense fans know all of the closest staffs to zb1 so pretty different than cside rumours that usually are from saesaengs or friends or family in the hariboz case although there is a few members with snake friends lol I had Taerae, Hanbin, Matthew and Haos finstas but everyone else but Matthew deactivated or stopped using it I&#x27;ll ask for new ones when I&#x27;m free tho I haven&#x27;t been in people&#x27;s business in a while I had yujins one too they all had like 11-14 followers and followed like 20 people you already know Taerae and Matthews username haos was like directly referencing his name and yujin and hanbin had the keyboard smashes ones and I&#x27;ve heard hanbin has or had several /+r/138859317066684445</p>
