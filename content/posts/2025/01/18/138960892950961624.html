      <p>I never once said rky doesn&#x27;t have real moments of mismanagement tho I&#x27;d always say every stupid complaint and act up by ryangis lessens the impact of things that actually matter like all the time ðŸ˜­ this is wkn issues are their second nature my point has always been that it&#x27;s less likely targeted and just an example of a poorly run company. Idk what this is all about but that does suck I&#x27;ve already got mention ab yh in my inbox but I woke up randomly and I&#x27;m bouncing so I&#x27;m not getting into that rn</p>
