        <p>im ngl while u sometimes have a point about ricky maybe not wanting to go on pluschat/do certain tiktoks + i definitely don&#x27;t think sinophobia is the factor (or at least primary factor) in play + riyangis are indeed dumb af w the way they go about things, i think there is pretty ample evidence that he is treated exceptionally poorly under wk1 (recent example: dispatch post on weibo with only 8 members)</p>

        <p>I never once said rky doesn&#x27;t have real moments of mismanagement tho I&#x27;d always say every stupid complaint and act up by ryangis lessens the impact of things that actually matter like all the time ðŸ˜­ this is wkn issues are their second nature my point has always been that it&#x27;s less likely targeted and just an example of a poorly run company. Idk what this is all about but that does suck I&#x27;ve already got mention ab yh in my inbox but I woke up randomly and I&#x27;m bouncing so I&#x27;m not getting into that rn</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m not sure what the yuehua asks are about but in regard to dispatch the only posted 8 members pics on Weibo but not Ricky which suprised me because the kr dispatch team seem to love Ricky like they always interact with him at the airport and make him the thumbnail so this did surprise me from their Weibo admin /+r/138960892950961624</p>
