        <p>https://x.com/popbinz/status/1880200696194294205 She forgot all these groups are from hybe and sm. These koreans (not gp) only care about them, and will ignore zb1 even if they give them good songs. I hope wk1 resorts to some sajaegi and does a lot of promo this time. Or else this cb will be a failure too, the boys actually want to give us a gp hit song but it can only happen with good promo.</p>

        <p>oh our bad zbwon arent from a kpop giant should they kill themselves? ugh i hate these brand of solo fans who think their poorly veiled hate for the group is some life changing critique WE DONT GIVE A FUCKKKKK WHAT U GOTTA SAY AND THATS NOT THE CASE. but ur also ragging too much even big4 groups dont get gp attention its very unlikely and fandoms matter the most which zbwon have theyll be fine</p>

      <p>Bgs will never hit again with the gp. Zb1 were the one who revived their hype for a bit. Riize got lucky with their debut and hybe is manipulating the charts for their bgs. Jyp is debuting a nbg soon but they have zero hype. Anyways 4gen bgs have proved that you don&#x27;t need the korean gp to hit big and zb1 have probably the strongest kfandom among the 5gen after plave, they only get discredited because they&#x27;re under wk1. /+r/138793794719142064</p>
