        <p>Because of this very reason I feel like they are just going to stick to 6 and have seungeon and yunseo. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs only 1 or 2 zb1 members and the gap would be too big to be understandable like it would just make more sense to keep those 6. /+r/141688986061200930</p>

        <p>Yea unless they have another yujin hiding somewhere they&#x27;re not gonna reconstruct a brand new group for yuehuaz. I can see them adding two trainees and dropping yunseo tbh like he&#x27;s not a gag and at least seungeon is needed. This makes me think of junhyeons group I forgot the name but he&#x27;s no longer the most popular member the new kid beat everyone out cuz he&#x27;s a visual and a singer so if they have someone like that it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad</p>

      <p>I&#x27;m literally begging them to drop yunseo let&#x27;s be fr need a real main dancer neither yujin nor hao are good enough for that ughhh I&#x27;m just afraid they&#x27;re keeping him because of the nayeon&#x27;s cousin nepotism like even brian was more popular and liked by kfans /+r/141923048222841557</p>
