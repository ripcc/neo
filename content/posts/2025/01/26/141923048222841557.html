        <p>ik u get irritated when ppl talk about the potential yuehua group after zb1, but i was just thinking that if it happens, there’s going to be a pretty insurmountable popularity gap between the zb1 members and whoever else gets added</p>

      <p>Yea unless they have another yujin hiding somewhere they&#x27;re not gonna reconstruct a brand new group for yuehuaz. I can see them adding two trainees and dropping yunseo tbh like he&#x27;s not a gag and at least seungeon is needed. This makes me think of junhyeons group I forgot the name but he&#x27;s no longer the most popular member the new kid beat everyone out cuz he&#x27;s a visual and a singer so if they have someone like that it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad</p>
