      <p>Idk if my ask was sent because neo is ass... i just wanted to say that i got curious after seeing you talk abt hao and hanbin potentially getting plastic surgery so i looked at their predebut pics and istg i don&#x27;t see it. Idgaf about plastic surgery but i just think hanbin lost a bunch of weight which can change one&#x27;s looks drastically, and hao has always had fuller lips, he&#x27;s just been overlining them af. Ik overlining the lips became a huge thing in 2024 in korea, aespa&#x27;s giselle was in soo many videos abt how this &quot;trend&quot; gave her a glowup. Again i really dgafðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ even if they did get plastic surgery i think they look amazing and fans always say the two of them look great irl so i guess props to the surgeons if they were involved</p>
