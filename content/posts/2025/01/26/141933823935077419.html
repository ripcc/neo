        <p>fuck it i would like to see it too it feels like zbwon have to prove that theyre actually worth their spot ad praise a show like this would gag even tho i hated everything about the original kingdom. actually... nvm i could see it going bad the big4 advantage plus zbwon would definitely go through the same alienation as tbz OH HELL NO</p>

      <p>Hella no I would be cursing wakeone if they send zb1 to kingdom. Kpop fans and knetz loves to glaze big4 for the bare minimum zb1 better make 100 cb instead of joining that stupid show /+r/141691386016783470</p>
