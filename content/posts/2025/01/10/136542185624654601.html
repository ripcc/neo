      <p>yall talk about things rosins do as if any of it is suprising. Idk if your anons are new to kpop but all big fandoms are the same. Armys, blinks, exols, etc. The biggest subfandoms are ofc going to be the most annoying and stupid because they&#x27;re comprised of a lot of people. And all akgaes are the exact same</p>
