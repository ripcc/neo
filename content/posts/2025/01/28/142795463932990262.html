        <p>It was allins, they were even harassing them in their latest post saying they should stop being spineless and take the criticism instead of running away ☠️ even saying they&#x27;re doing this to take the attention away from hanbin&#x27;s mistreatment like bye these people are evil /+r/142377637116074325</p>
