        <p>to me it&#x27;s just so sick that they&#x27;re the most loved and famous yet the ones that have to disband like everything&#x27;s so unfair. izna is permanent while kep1er is clearly outlasting zb1... these wakeone artists are gonna be surviving off jo yuri&#x27;s squid game cheques when zb1 is gone before wakeonez debut and obviously they won&#x27;t pull in zb1 profit ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ /+r/142364751123667671</p>
