      <p>depends how well the ngg does. aespa debuted in the middle of irene&#x27;s power scandal just like how red velvet debuted in the year of kris and luhan leaving exo, jessica&#x27;s departure from snsd and sulli&#x27;s hiatus, red velvet still had a couple of hits after aespa&#x27;s debut and they had better longevity in korea than twice did. This might be their last peak year before smngg takes over as the trendy gg with a big hit, but i feel like smngg is to aespa like how f(x) is to snsd in a way aespa imo is SM&#x27;s biggest group since exo /+r/142472978582689324</p>
