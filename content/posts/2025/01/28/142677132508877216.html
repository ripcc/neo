        <p>I really love the fan culture in Japan. I searched Hao&#x27;s name yesterday to look for repos for the handshake event and one of his fans posted about not seeing many older women and she was nervous because it&#x27;s her 1st time without her circle of friends. Her daughter is a Ricky fan and I think she&#x27;s around 40yo. Another one is an older woman too with her husband (they are so sweet ðŸ˜­) and a Hanini plushie is hanging on her bag. I want to grow old like them. ðŸ˜­ I remember during the concert, Jzeroses are posting their kids attending with them. Lots of Hao fans carrying Haninis. I envy Japan because they arent discriminating fans because of their age like what international fans are doing. You know, the &quot;you&#x27;re pushing 30 blah blah blah...&quot;</p>
