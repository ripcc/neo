      <p>regarding the comment about jw - was there any actual proof of him having the girlfriend? because i didnt saw any actual proof of that. i remember hearing that someone posted about this on instiz but i wouldnt call it a fully credbile source of information. from what i saw he still has quite a lot of korean fans, even more than mtw i think.</p>
