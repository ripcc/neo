      <p>Saw this on my tl and I’m genuinely interested in how rosins can glaze him and gwan this ‘friendship’ so much but then kts over moments between certain members of zb1 and hao. Like hj was literally designed to be a hao 2.0 and hybes attempted to ‘replace’ him in the market as the successful Chinese idol like it all got spilled in the docs so I can’t really view these things the way I would have before all that info came out. https://x.com/suikameow/status/1877743059577778621?s=46</p>
