        <p>i saw that hb mentioned gunwook on his live. he was talking about how he could talk about anything with gunwook. last time they talked about the four folks that reigned over the world or some shit ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ nerds. im sure that talking to gunwook makes hanbin feel smart after spending time with gyuvin /+r/135787277153689425</p>

      <p>I find this really cute and sweet tbh, Iâ€™m kinda like Gunwook where I have so much knowledge on the most random things but I donâ€™t think people are that interested so when you find someone that is genuinely interested in what you are saying and engages with it itâ€™s really nice ðŸ¥¹ /+r/135809506054723979</p>
