        <p>Haven&#x27;t kept up w zb1 since forever other than haobin ocasionally but I saw the gunwook song today andthought of you, it&#x27;s genuinely great? Like I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so good and I didn&#x27;t exoect him to have a rnb sound which fits him perfectly, it might be one of if not my favourite song from zb1 period</p>
