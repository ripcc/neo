        <p>https://x.com/pannchoa/status/1877812397659898255?s=46 There is no way this isn’t clear payola. Like they probably bought the albums in advance, expected it to sale or just wanted to deceive their sells numbers, and return them when they realized they weren’t getting what they wanted. 100k albums is insane. This + the fact they lost 2 sponsorships including Pocari (AND the fact New Jeans were declared the biggest kpop act in 2024 by the Japanese music charts) oh illit have a lot against them. They might be done tbh. Not to be like “they’re old” because they are like what, a year old? But their reputation + the fact they already lost huge sponsors are going to follow them for years. During that time there very well might be new girl groups to flock over to (especially the new SM girl group). Allegedly Min Hee Jin also privately submitted to the court over a thousand instances of Belift copying her, and like a thousand things of evidence is pretty damning 😭 idk 🤷  I knew since their survival show they might be cursed. It’s just so much</p>
