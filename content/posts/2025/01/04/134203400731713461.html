        <p>i mean, let&#x27;s look at the bigger picture. if ever he is back to jellyfish, being musical actor is the best route. they are held in higher position compared to idols and jelpi got lots of musical connection. numerous musical actors are either actor or singer at the same time and they get more attention amongst gp. if gunwook has build a nice foundation there he can achieve his dream to be an idol for a long time. see it as achieving his dreams through different route. better choice than being piled up with random zero aura trainees /+r/131700704023895996</p>
