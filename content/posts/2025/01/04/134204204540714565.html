        <p>hmmmm gwks not a super physically affectionate person and Matthew is special it doesn&#x27;t read as a brother relationship at all it&#x27;s a secret third thing tbh like this is just bait that got too real but they&#x27;re still bros but have concepts of a freak. shipping them is too easy tbhðŸ˜­</p>
