      <p>Anon you must be new here, anything hanbin said that we side eyed he got lashed for all the way back since cc days. But Iâ€™ll admit heâ€™s never said anything like this, most of what heâ€™s said was something that was just taken a diffrent way by tweaker zerose but heâ€™s never got on a live and complained about lines or screentime. The only odd thing I can think off is the love you 3000 thing that was like over a year ago now so itâ€™s not like heâ€™s a repeat offender either ðŸ˜­ /+r/139913368311127014</p>
