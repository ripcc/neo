      <p>i was bored just now and doing some lurking, trying to find accounts of their staff and i know it was shared here before that their a&amp;r came from jype and apparently got itzy some of their worst comebacks but i scrolled down what seems to be their visual director&#x27;s ig account and come to find that they also came from jype. AND i just found one of (?) their stylists who used to work with skz (tho they&#x27;ve worked with a bunch of groups so i guess they&#x27;re not tied down to one and it might not be that deep). idk if these ones are known or not but did wakeone just kidnap a bunch of staff from jype like what goes onnnnnnn</p>
