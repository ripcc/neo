      <p>Part of me wishes this was released a week or two later so they had a chance to actually promote it because they are in Thailand till Wednesday and then come back on Thursday for Emka. Fly out on Friday for Japan schedules then have 4 days no schedule till laposta. I feel like they could have done music shows and maybe radio show in that time. I love the song and wish it was going to get better promo tbh, releasing it so close to the Japan cb was an odd choice</p>

      <p>it would do so well if they properly promoted but I&#x27;ll bite my tongue since it&#x27;s a prerelease iirc sweat only got a week. at least we have a song everyone likes this time and smrh to fill the empty time with but the crosspromoting is def gonna bite them in the ass soon</p>
