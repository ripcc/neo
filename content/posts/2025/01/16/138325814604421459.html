        <p>its super easy to sign up and curate a feed but its definitely going to get in the way of things and im dreading the day people start crossposting things they shouldnt ðŸ˜‘...... i dont think people will last long on the app but theres a chance we could be blocked off from seeing chinese content in general since the influx of americans joined this whole things just really annoying WE WERE HERE FIRST CAN EVERYBODY LEAVEEEEE OMG</p>

      <p>after i sent this i saw a tweet from an engene about how they kept seeing all the chinese sasaeng content (it was specifically a screenshot of a xhs post that had a pic taken from a close walking distance behind sunoo late at night and he looked like he was smiling away and unbothered tbh LMAO) like i often see them complain about how bad enhypen&#x27;s sasaengs are but bc of the mass xhs migration now they&#x27;re seeing actual proof rather than just hearing about it and i&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the case for other kpop stans too lmaooooooo /+r/138198924149347743</p>
