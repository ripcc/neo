        <p>do y&#x27;all actually think it is fake? I even saw people in dc being more angry about wk1 not replying than about Hanbin losing the china personal schedule. They are like if the schedules don&#x27;t match, at least reply that he can&#x27;t do it. From what they were talking about I think it is a pictorial. Some of them are even going &quot;compensate with a korean pictorial at least&quot;.... These girls don&#x27;t really care about the offer but more about how the company is incompetent, and hanbin(or any member) could&#x27;ve lost more because of them not replying.... Also, I remember something like this happened with hao bar too /+r/138207149884136184</p>

        <p>I don&#x27;t think so like literally why would this be a lie and used as a pressure ploy wkn isn&#x27;t doing anything they don&#x27;t want to or said no to ðŸ˜­ and yea they seem mad at how everything&#x27;s being handled and that it could mess things up for hbn</p>
