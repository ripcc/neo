        <p>hi req, random but i really want to ask all of the rosins or just zeroses in general here, for haoâ€™s photos 90% of the time i like his own bts photos way more than the magazine and esp the album ones, they always feel very flat to me and idk just worse and i wonder if others feel the same</p>

      <p>another anon and i think its because most of the poses or shots they chose to put as a cover or make official are the ones that look the same. he is always standing while looking at the camera with the same expression, it can get boring cause they dont try anything different. hao lying down while wearing that one white gown type looking things is one of my fave shots of him because of that reason (other shots looking too alike) /+r/138326433515919414</p>
