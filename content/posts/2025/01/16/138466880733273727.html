        <p>Idk if anon is trolling but why do you want to compare sales when hanbin isn&#x27;t as popular and doesn&#x27;t have a big fandom there ðŸ˜­ ngl this whole thing is so odd what&#x27;s funny is his cbar didn&#x27;t even post anything about it on weibo knowing it&#x27;d make them and him a laughing stock, Everyone knows brands/companies in china give offers depending on demand and sales and data, so unless his cbar has been begging someone for an offer i can&#x27;t even guess what it could be like the guy isn&#x27;t even known lol no shade /+r/138332620479225569</p>

      <p>I mean brands/mags have worked with lesser known kpop idols in China all the time so nothing new imo it&#x27;s really the top mags that are more selective also I&#x27;m surprised gyuvin doesn&#x27;t have a solo Chinese mag yet, predicting he&#x27;ll get one before disbandment /+r/138404601098621581</p>
