      <p>i was wondering if they&#x27;d be annoyed not only bc of the art style but bc he&#x27;s a japanese artist and it looks random so far like i feel like it&#x27;d have made more sense for him to do art for now or never which has a slightly darker vibe mv wise (tho then again we don&#x27;t know much about doctor doctor so maybe it fits and is somehow cohesive) /+r/138406936180907948</p>
