        <p>idk how you were into that in the first place it&#x27;s the stalest shit ever BUT SIS IDK MATTWOOK HAVE MOMENTS FOR DAYSSSSSS you just have to like Matthew and the dynamic like they&#x27;re so close and bring each other up so often it&#x27;s hard not to like. I love everything about them like wow I was talking about them today with my friends and almost died LIKE WOW THESE ARE THE FUCKING GOATS PLEASE STAY TOGETHER FOREVER 😭😭😭🩷🩷🩷🩷 Idk what it&#x27;s like to like the duo from a seokryu point of view but as a gpd Matthew was literally the first person to really extend his hand to gwk when the group formed and took care of him and for that he&#x27;ll always have a special place in my heart so I just love the dynamic cuz it&#x27;s so genuine the ship side is even more tea cuz it&#x27;s freaky yasssssss wow u got me too lit bro come to the good side it&#x27;s time you eat real food</p>

      <p>idk if it’s just me but i cannot get into popular duos for the life of me like i used to be a gyubriker then the ship blew up and i muted their names because it just got annoying as fuuuck but i think it was just because of the ones who think ricky’s a girl lmfaoaoao I’m getting there with mattparkz though pls root for meeee sista😭😭😭😭😭 and sorry i know this’ll piss u off but being a taegunv shipper is such a fun experience sometimes like u lowkey have no choice but to treat crumbs like four-course meals and the korean geontaelers thrive even in the deepest pits of poverty like those girls get LITTTT over them standing next to eo in the airport /+r/136543390975349928</p>

      <p>im kinda like that but i dont deny myself tea. and also the fans being annoying and stupid stopping your enjoyment is reasonable like even i dropped mattwook for a bit cuz of the way people painted gwk but its all good now good luck 💁‍♀️. and i mean irdc it was just never for me i will say i was always jelly of the fanart cuz thats my favorite thing but these people just wanna keep begging mid THEY CAN HAVE IT!!!! i could always tell the lack of everything was a bit of a charm point thats kinda how i moved with rkgw in 2023 but im not built for the losing team like that</p>
