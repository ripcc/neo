      <p>&quot;are you stupid&quot; proceeds to be stupid by assuming that i just meant those were hao&#x27;s vapes when i never said that and what i meant is the vapes were in his presence in pics which COULD lead to hate . anyways i never said it was for certain that he or any other member would get dragged into a similar scandal but we can almost never have a good day which is why i get weary of celebrations over scandals.. like we can&#x27;t laugh TOO much yk lmao i&#x27;m just a bit traumatised my bad! /+r/156209364762579639</p>
