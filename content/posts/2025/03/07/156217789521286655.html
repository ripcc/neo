        <p>1B100 accused SM of blocking xiumin on music bank because KBS told 1B100 (CBX company) that they can&#x27;t let xiumin promote at the same time as SM artists. Because of that, all ONE HUNDRED artists are boycotting KBS, including lee mujin who is under BPM (a subsidiary of ONE HUNDRED) /+r/156208295517050931</p>
