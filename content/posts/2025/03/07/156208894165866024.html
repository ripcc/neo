        <p>Why are zeroses blaming solos when the voting score was perfect and the problem was their digitals were too low?? ðŸ˜­ is there not a single person with a functioning brain in this fandom or are they all sheep and tweet the same thing in different fonts for a hit tweet</p>

      <p>i&#x27;m ngl making tweets about encouraging voting is good but picking fights with solos and just random blaming tells me most of these twitter don&#x27;t really care about jebis and just want the usual FUCK AKGAES I&#x27;M AN OT9 brownie points tweets because voting isn&#x27;t even one of our weakness points, it&#x27;s streaming and if they want to call someone out it should be their kfans who embarrassed the fuck out of the group with those digitals like come on now, plus do they really think doing this will encourage solos to vote more? ðŸ¥´ /+r/156111703636136314</p>
