      <p>I cant even understand what this company is doing, like 1 week of cb promo is crazy. the just finished a tour not even 4 months ago and its their final year as a group they cant afford to spend most the year touring, at least not the first half. /+r/156356601966714557</p>

      <p>theyre rlly all ab how they can make the most money without any effort....... this is terrible news to me like omggggg why are yall doing a tour that you only just recovered from.. YOU DONT HAVE TIME ðŸ˜‘ but walk with me here i feel like we might jumped the gun a bit. everyone was so sure that theyd do an actual world tour 2023-early2024 and it ended up being a Q4 asia tour only and judging off the wording and time frame theyre gonna release ticketing between now and april and have a concert on june or smth. they specifically said &quot;concert&quot; when they called timeless world a &quot;tour&quot; so idk.. and presale is exclusive to the 2nd membership that ends in 2 months so sales have to be starting soon. cmiiw but for reference timeless world was announced around april? and ticketing started around july onwards IDK.. IDK.. IM STILL SCARED THO</p>
