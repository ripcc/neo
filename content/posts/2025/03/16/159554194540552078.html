      <p>imo ricky is fine with the gf stan fanservice if u just stick to fancalls/ fansigns and dont ask for weird shit like old sklen but once u stalk/ follow him it breaks the illusion because he doesnt interact with u outside of work but matthew its friendly both on and off work so his illusion is more &#x27;real&#x27; if that makes sense /+r/159548406547832489</p>
