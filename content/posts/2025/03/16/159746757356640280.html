        <p>Anons and 80% of his fandom just don&#x27;t get him he&#x27;s literally one of the straightest members like it kills me ðŸ˜­ My analysis with him is he&#x27;s &#x27;freaky&#x27; but pretty average for your typical teenage/ young adult male it&#x27;s just the others aren&#x27;t as open as him due to well, being in a conservative backwards country like Korea where these topics are taboo to talk about openly but Rik doesn&#x27;t care, probably because of his American upbringing where it&#x27;s more normalized. And let&#x27;s be real we all know those innocent beloved oppas be watching singles inferno too. For me he gives &#x27;hopeless romantic dreamer&#x27; but he&#x27;s been hurt and not hurt specifically from like an ex but just his upbringing in general, probably leeches trying to use him cause he&#x27;s rich ðŸ˜­ so he has trust issues and it lines up because he&#x27;s so introverted and explains why his circle is so small yet even then he still prefers to chill by himself most of the time. He&#x27;s not my bias but totally my type, the kind where he&#x27;s really independent with 2 close friends but once he finds a girl who can break his walls that he can trust he&#x27;ll give her his all and that&#x27;s the vibes I get from watching him and hearing his past anecdotes here. /+r/159700233268449351</p>
