        <p>predicting post zb1 member controversies jiwoong: shotgun wedding, scamming
hanbin: he gets an acting gig in a cj drama and is absolute shit or he gets a major variety gig passed on from someone famous where hes too boring
hao: some type of nationalism controversy that makes either chinese or korean ppl really mad lowkey a right of passage for cn idols
matt: idk he’ll prob suffer from the switch up most ppl have on english speaking idols after saying something vaguely controversial/cringe or him being too nice to everyone that talks to him is gonna lead to someone taking advantage of him
taerae: filler addiction/bad ps, shading zb1 members
ricky: drops a clothing line thats super basic but really overpriced and gets called out for scamming fans, tries acting but is super stiff and awkward
gyuv: being nugu is gonna hit him hard and he’ll be going on live for 2-3 hours a day saying stupid shit that gets him in trouble and he’ll be too old for fans to coddle him
gwk: idk hes forever a troll victim but he might get sloppy abt hiding that hes dating
yujin: his kfans get pissed as fuck that hes too close to his cfans and yuehua will also cater more to his rich cfans adding to it, vaping</p>
