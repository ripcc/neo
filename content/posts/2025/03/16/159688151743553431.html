        <p>no it should be a bachelors in psychology if it&#x27;s 독학학위제 (a self study degree) and they offer 11 majors. performing arts isn&#x27;t one but psych is and that&#x27;s what he told the fan he&#x27;s majoring in. I think it&#x27;s confusing to people in countries that don&#x27;t have it but it&#x27;s an alternate way to get a bachelors. that&#x27;s probably why he&#x27;s taking extra language classes too like it&#x27;s helpful to his idol career but foreign language is also a subject on the national exam /+r/159522748073464813</p>

        <p>I can&#x27;t wrap my head around it since bachelors is only possible through 4 years in America but that&#x27;s cool</p>
