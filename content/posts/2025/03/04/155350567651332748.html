        <p>Someone pointed out how Ricky is the only one who never films challanges with the other yuehuaz which just further solidifies to me my theory of they don’t like him (yh the company) or he’s not staying there</p>

      <p>Isn&#x27;t it about image? They/he are/is building the cool untouchable image? But sometimes I think he&#x27;s struggling more than he let&#x27;s on. Like he&#x27;s struggling to adapt to the culture and nuances of traditional kpop (being a trainee is diff from being an actual idol) to the point he doesn&#x27;t even want it anymore.i could see him wanting to do more kpop rnb and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the future Yuehuaz will be doing /+r/154583309618467844</p>
