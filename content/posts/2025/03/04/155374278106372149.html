        <p>also it is not like only aespa does it. Isn&#x27;t it unfair to only hate them when most koreans do this even non idols. I remember even hanbin talking about applying this tone up cream once (during mama). It feels more targeted and misogynistic seeing armys and other kpop fans trying to hate on them, when their idols are also probably doing this. If they all talked about the issue here instead of just dragging aespa alone, maybe then i&#x27;d take them seriously. /+r/155070892672768674</p>

        <p>right gbfjgfj i was ab to go on a rant but i stopped myself everyones acting like aespa are bringing harm it doesnt feel like people defending and attacking are even talking ab the issue of colorism its just a gotcha and by the most annoying ppl too all idols do this lets move on. and no shade the kids looking up to them are probably from places where this is already normalized aespa arent gonna change that</p>
