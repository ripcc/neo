        <p>just went on the zb1 subreddit for the first time in ages and it&#x27;s kinda woongdeongie central over there, it&#x27;s a bit wild to witness since with twitter you can just curate what you see much easier..... also a whole lot of moping, not even just the woongdeongies but it&#x27;s a constant mistreatment off with all the members. i used to be of the belief that reddit kpop fans were more chilled out than twitter ones but nah the past few months (like especially with the newjeans situation lmao) they&#x27;re terrible and delusional too ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>someone on there was insinuating that mattparkz is being pushed and it seems forced (i checked the post history and you guessed it, it comes from a woongdeongie lmao), one saying they block everything to do with it on social media, and then on this ama a zerose living in korea was doing there were a million questions about people hating jiwoong and if he&#x27;s supported like oh brother ðŸ˜­ /+r/155352967141349816</p>
