      <p>nah i&#x27;m pretty sure this is the choreo they all do and hanbin said that their stage outfits made it hard to see all the details, at least that&#x27;s what i saw in some translation tweet about this clip /+r/158238624767498662</p>

      <p>The translation I read said it was more of the &quot;dramatic&quot; version that they cut down but it could be a wardrobe thing they cut it down for I&#x27;m just glad they did it in general this is beggary</p>
