      <p>I mean personally I would like him to have a job where I don&#x27;t have to also watch jaehyun ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but yeah he&#x27;s never going to be unemployed the proper narrative they should go for is him being overworked because it&#x27;s insane to have him do a special stage in the middle of comeback week while sick /+r/153957163621111886</p>
