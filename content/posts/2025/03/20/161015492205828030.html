        <p>http://xhslink.com/a/1LVJ1ebCQFc8 This is interesting it&#x27;s how some people buy fancall spots from proxies I would have never guessed that eunseok has the most expensive calls in riizeðŸ¤” Maybe this was just for one call because I can&#x27;t see wonbin not being first. Jisung for nct dream and soobin for txt being highest are also actually different from what I expected too I thought it would be one of mark/haechan and yeonjun. Also zb1 are so expensive for a 5th gen group?? We&#x27;re basically matching nct dream</p>

      <p>is this basically buying a spot into a fancall from someone who&#x27;s actually gotten in without having to buy all the albums and such yourself? this reminds me of before covid and fancalls existing when international fans would buy fansign slots and then have the person who went to the fansign ask questions to their bias and get them a signed page or album i lowkey remember being jealous of that LMAO. that but actually being able to get into the fancall and talk to the idol yourself is wild to me (if that&#x27;s the case) /+r/161001386673397674</p>

      <p>im not 100% sure i didnt translate the post but from guessing i would say theyre doing the album code thing theyre basically paying for the fansign cut without actually buying the physical album (its just annoying to have all that) so theyll receive the codes at that price w a guarantee of getting in i could be wrong tho lolll. im positive you cant just buy someones slot your name has to be the same and you wouldnt wanna receive an album w someone elses name. and i rmbr thatttttt the amt of times i almost folded IT WAS TOO TEA BACK THEN</p>
