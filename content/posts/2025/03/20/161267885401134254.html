      <p>Wonder why hanbin wasn’t at the fs today, I’m he said on pc something about having to work overtime (making me think it’s something to do with mca) but i don’t think it was planned because from what i understand his gs slots only got postponed today where if it was planned they would have told those people who won a while ago</p>
