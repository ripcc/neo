      <p>it&#x27;s not based on chinese popularity like in what world is hb more popular than yj or rk in china lmaooo i think a lot of factors go into it including popularity ofc but also the level of fanservice and how responsive the idol is in fancalls which means more fans would want to have a fancall with them etc with wb&#x27;s dry paint personality i&#x27;m not surprised tho and he is more popular than shitseok everywhere tbh /+r/161194655478930421</p>
