        <p>i think its hao too but thats cause he has the biggest fandom so wide range of fans but imo its not gonna hit him as much as ricky and hanbin who&#x27;s half the fandom is consist of only that and tbh if hao stays with yuehua they are just gonna find another target ðŸ˜­ /+r/160847502227234609</p>

        <p>imo haos fandom is similar as well he has the larger fandom so automatically larger influx of fans who participate for the rage but its rlly not a huge proportional difference. cuz no shade rosinism has been built on schizobabble just as much as allinsim and riyangism if not more ðŸ˜­ hell retain a lot of those fans if he redebuts in yh quick enough but that could be more negative than losing them</p>
