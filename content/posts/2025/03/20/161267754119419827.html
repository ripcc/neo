      <p>Hao ducati leather jacket is sold out in less than 1 hour. I&#x27;m not denying fans impact but usually fans will highlight their idol achievement but rosins is so weird they always make it about their sf. Every post i see abt it so far the captions are &quot;rosins power, rosins is insane, rosins buying power, and the total sales&quot; instead of &quot;Hao&#x27;s impact, hao sold out king or something like this&quot;ðŸ˜­</p>
