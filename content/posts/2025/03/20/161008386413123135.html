        <p>If anyone finds her new account, then it is easy to find her twitter account too. She should be careful after losing her old weibo account but it seems like she doesn&#x27;t want to be careful because she posted about getting cancelled and all her friends follow her already. And didn&#x27;t noir know about her too or am I wrong? But they are not mutuals in twitter. /+r/160473934914081319</p>
