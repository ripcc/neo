        <p>akgaes will never admit it but a lot of them are addicted to the rush of being an akgae more than being actually a fan of their fav. they find comfort in complaining and when their fav is in a environment where they are free they will leave their side. i feel like ricky is most likely to have more of these than anyone else /+r/160542825845576989</p>
