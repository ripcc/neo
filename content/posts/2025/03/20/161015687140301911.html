        <p>he&#x27;s gonna be worked to the bone like yibo yuehua just singled him out in a company article yesterday and was bragging about him they did not even mention other yeuhuaz member or zb1 at all ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ But he&#x27;s prolly gonna have more freedom if he knows how to work around his contract plus he was just a trainee for a shortwhile so trainee debt isnt much of a problem like everglow /+r/160845685418317220</p>
