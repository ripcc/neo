        <p>This is going to be an extremely boiling hot take and I didnâ€™t come down to this conclusion till today till I saw a certain report. Just want to clarify I donâ€™t ship haobin, not bias hanbin or hao but as a large part of the fandom individually and as a duo itâ€™s hard to miss what goes on with them. I 100% agree shippers get more comfortable asking hao stuff because they speak the same language but Iâ€™m sorry I can completely coddle this grown man. Half the reason why the questions have gotten as invasive as they have is because he does feed into them and he does give them answers they want and yes sometimes they fish for answers but Iâ€™ve seen equally as many repos where he could have given normal answers and chose not too. Thereâ€™s also the argument that shippers will scold them, Iâ€™m sorry to tell you but both these men are going to get scolded anyway, for handing out with other men for not posting with eachother ect. Like at a certain point we have to acknowledge it takes two to tango and it didnâ€™t get this bad on its own. *************** Yes I think the shippers should learn some boundaries and respect too but haoâ€™s 24 and extremely smart he knows what heâ€™s doing too. /+r/160123101693304705</p>

        <p>imma have to agree with you its naive to think this manifested purely from one side theres a lot to say on boundaries but thats not the only thing like plz ðŸ˜­</p>
