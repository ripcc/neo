        <p>checkd the account out of curiosity and it actually doesnt look like an account handled by professionals that you expect from bibigo since its a big company. their japan an usa accounts were aight though. somebody pointed out that kr didn&#x27;t have x link in their website while US and japan have. The account actually looks sus imho. the bibigo kr Instagram is their only social listed. the account being created june 2024 and only started posting Feb this year with who made this post and following bunch of hanbin fans while bibigo usa is following influencers, doctors, restaurants and businesses like a proper business account is kinda the takeaway /+r/160118615654489362</p>
