      <p>Would write him as an evil pimp but it depends on the story he might be the bus driver... he might be the killer... he might be the relationship plot device that gets trashed... endless possibilities ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è there was this one fic I liked that basically had jwg and tr as devices for mattwooks relationship IT WAS TOOOOOO TEA</p>
