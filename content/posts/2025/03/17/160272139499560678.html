        <p>This is going to be an extremely boiling hot take and I didnâ€™t come down to this conclusion till today till I saw a certain report. Just want to clarify I donâ€™t ship haobin, not bias hanbin or hao but as a large part of the fandom individually and as a duo itâ€™s hard to miss what goes on with them. I 100% agree shippers get more comfortable asking hao stuff because they speak the same language but Iâ€™m sorry I can completely coddle this grown man. Half the reason why the questions have gotten as invasive as they have is because he does feed into them and he does give them answers they want and yes sometimes they fish for answers but Iâ€™ve seen equally as many repos where he could have given normal answers and chose not too. Thereâ€™s also the argument that shippers will scold them, Iâ€™m sorry to tell you but both these men are going to get scolded anyway, for handing out with other men for not posting with eachother ect. Like at a certain point we have to acknowledge it takes two to tango and it didnâ€™t get this bad on its own. *************** Yes I think the shippers should learn some boundaries and respect too but haoâ€™s 24 and extremely smart he knows what heâ€™s doing too. /+r/160123101693304705</p>

      <p>I can&#x27;t speak for all shippers they&#x27;re not always going to be right or be a hive mind there&#x27;s plenty of ppl that acknowledge the boundary issue across all different type of fan relationships. But you can&#x27;t always win gndnncmcnc and it&#x27;s crazy to think about how most active zroses are notttttt the same ones from 2 yrs ago they don&#x27;t got a clue in the world ab their history i cant comprehend it</p>
