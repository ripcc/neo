      <p>https://neospring.org/+r/159752086203093997 this reminds me of when jebis tiktoks get featured on the news cause its a trend, but agreed this rarely happens on other network features cause it&#x27;s usually the big 4 or v big named kr stars, good for zgh....it also just reassures me that ZB1 is truly bigger than some people may think in kr, like we compare them often to a lotta big 4 groups. Still, the fact that they can even compete with these groups just provides they ain&#x27;t nugu cause I&#x27;ve seen some truly nugu groups and it always surprises me how many groups actually debut each year and only like 5% ever &quot;succeed&quot; and gain traction.</p>

      <p>people always do too much comparing them to the impossible when the reality is that if they switched places with the other big4 groups those groups would&#x27;ve met their end already ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
