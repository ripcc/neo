      <p>are you able to see the timeless world movie? apparently lots of places aren&#x27;t showing it and it&#x27;s annoying me like what&#x27;s the point if people who can&#x27;t see the concert physically in person can&#x27;t see it in cinemas either? like my country&#x27;s main cinema company has it in their website but when you try and select dates to buy tickets for there&#x27;s like no dates that show the movie so i don&#x27;t get why it&#x27;s on the website if they&#x27;re not showing it or why they&#x27;re not selling tickets if they are showing it, but apparently lots of people are experiencing that regardless of country/cinema so i guess we&#x27;re all in this together</p>
