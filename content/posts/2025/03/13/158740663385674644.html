      <p>https://x.com/kchartsmaster/status/1900116608112013655 This is what i mean when i said mbc got lots of shady shit going on because they are owned by the government. They know no one can touch them. Thank goodness their shows suck, including wild idol. Still hate how they gaslight underage gunwook with &quot;you will never gain attention if you are not doing sexy pose&quot; bullshits, put a literal minor for men&#x27;s health photoshoot was a crazy stunt</p>
