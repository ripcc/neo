        <p>just went on the zb1 subreddit for the first time in ages and it&#x27;s kinda woongdeongie central over there, it&#x27;s a bit wild to witness since with twitter you can just curate what you see much easier..... also a whole lot of moping, not even just the woongdeongies but it&#x27;s a constant mistreatment off with all the members. i used to be of the belief that reddit kpop fans were more chilled out than twitter ones but nah the past few months (like especially with the newjeans situation lmao) they&#x27;re terrible and delusional too üò≠</p>
