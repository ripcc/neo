      <p>That is not true at all they&#x27;re heavy into their payola it&#x27;s just subtler than bringing flop groups to lolla. they&#x27;re realistic and wouldn&#x27;t do that but trust they love forcing fame through articles and fudged numbers + they have an automatic cult following that justifies things better</p>
