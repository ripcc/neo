      <p>the thing is not all members are close w each other and you know what thats fine they dont all have to be super close but you can tell that they at least get along and are comfortable around each other, but with jiwoong everything feels sooo awkward it’s like he does Not belong there, and he makes it worse by not even trying</p>
