      <p>I think jiwoong is desperate to be out of the group but he still trying hard to bond with members idk why maybe likes them about tae they have on and off relationship and in recent zbtv taerae said i think its jwng who wants independence and am sure jwng definitely packed his bags and waiting for 2026 in his vlog he said i hope members are my real friend and if you see ricky is also dont give him fck</p>

      <p>this was a bit hard to understand but yea he&#x27;s never had a team kind of passion for the group otherwise he would&#x27;ve been behaving different from day 1. I can&#x27;t even really call him ambition driven either he&#x27;s just reaping the benefits of everything and chilling.. it&#x27;s quite annoying he&#x27;ll get to live a good life after they disband since he&#x27;s easily the least attached to their branding and idol life</p>
