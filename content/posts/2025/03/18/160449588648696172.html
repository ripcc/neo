        <p>It&#x27;s because wk1 doesn&#x27;t have staff who speak chinese who can interfere when these things happen, so the it&#x27;s up to the Chinese members to handle everything not just freak shippers but weird gf stan requests even antis etc like... I&#x27;ve seen other kpop groups and the staff would immediately try to end the conversation/interaction when the fan starts getting weird and that&#x27;s also why these weird interactions never come from kfans ehhh it&#x27;s just sad atp /+r/160133335501462805</p>
