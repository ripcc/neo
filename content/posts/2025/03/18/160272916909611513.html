        <p>I know cfans bring in the most money but at the same time concerts or fancons whatever they&#x27;re doing should prioritize domestic fans first because sometimes I&#x27;d see kpop groups going to Indonesia for example but all the vip, barricades, floor are all cfans because of ticket scalpers so I just feel bad for them but at the same time I get cfans because they have the hallyu ban so they could only see kpop groups if they go to Macau or fly to Korea, Japan or sea countries but there should be a balance. /+r/160091277784994115</p>
