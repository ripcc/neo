      <p>is this about 2d1n when matthew voted for both ricky and gunwook but gunwook told him he had to only vote for one of them and then ricky ended up getting 0 votes while every other member got at least 1 ðŸ˜­ on a similar note, while watching 2d1n i had the thought that zb1 are quite like an older gen group in how they make fun/joke with each other like they&#x27;re often making &#x27;snarky&#x27; quips about each other wow their fans do not deserve them with how childish these subfandoms are LMAO /+r/154552753354660791</p>
