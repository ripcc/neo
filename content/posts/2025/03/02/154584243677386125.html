      <p>there is no science idk ab these other shippers I only know like 2 besides myself lmaooo but I&#x27;ve disliked gunrae before I even liked mattwook (the portrayal of their ship was gutterbutt GARBAGE) this is homegrown 2023 hate hennyyyyyy ever since tr made that joke saying gwk looks like a school bully he&#x27;s never been on my good side 🤷‍♀️ and there was a time where I liked mattrae but I just don&#x27;t now and it&#x27;s low vibrational</p>
