      <p>kpop is full of inflated numbers and chart manipulation esp from big4, hybe being the biggest offender of this like this is why a lot of people say that &quot;hybe ruined kpop&quot; because they make their artists seem bigger with inflated stats like nothing in kpop is real anymore ngl i think the biggest proof of how big an artist is if they can fill seats in a concert and zb1 does just that, mind you they have the highest attended concerts for 5th gen /+r/154410372827403421</p>
