        <p>I mean personally I would like him to have a job where I don&#x27;t have to also watch jaehyun ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but yeah he&#x27;s never going to be unemployed the proper narrative they should go for is him being overworked because it&#x27;s insane to have him do a special stage in the middle of comeback week while sick /+r/153957163621111886</p>

      <p>Ok I‚Äôm glad someone said it because I was talking to my moots and they thought it wasn‚Äôt a big deal but he‚Äôs been talking about taking medicine and been sick for over a week. Ik it was sohees last mca but why would you let a sick artist do a special stage the same day he has to record 2 other stages and mc and host a live all on the very first day of promotion /+r/154410920905495374</p>
