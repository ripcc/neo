        <p>Just had a thought if the cb would be more successful if devil game was the title track i just checked some accs and hao is averaging 10k likes on devil game cuts for this weeks stages and the response on tiktok about the song is good too. I watched a reaction video and they were shocked that they chose blue as the title track too</p>
