        <p>can I say smth and nobody shoot me nfnfncnncnc the reason zroses are gay obsessed is cuz of jaobin THERE I SAID IT ik someones gonna get mad but with how fast the ship grew, finale, their unique relationship it basically turned every ship into free game on being real and ultimate gayness so it&#x27;s no wonder</p>

      <p>clock that tea sis.
and when i say a lot if not all of it comes from fetishization of gay men ðŸ˜‚ because if haobin weren&#x27;t gay the fandom wouldn&#x27;t be this insane about the ship i see other idols do much worse fanservice but their fans aren&#x27;t overly dramatic about it because they know it&#x27;s fanservice but to zeroses.. well /+r/156964937133150800</p>
