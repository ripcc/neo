        <p>can i be honest üòÇ if shippers use rps names and talk in their circle then idgaf. but solos making those things go outside their circle and bringing attention to it is lowkey worse because they‚Äôre the ones making it become more popular and using government names like.. if solos just ignored shippers none of this would be happening bruh. they just want something to hate and get pissy over but the best thing to do for hanbin and hao would be to ignore shippers and leave them be instead of drawing attention to it. like, they hate shippers more than they like their bias lol. that said, i think shippers need to be more careful of not use haobin and only use rps names like bnb or whatever.</p>

      <p>i think part of why the rps stuff spreads so much is bc in other fandoms (idk about now but at least in the past), rps accounts would only interact with rps accounts but when it comes to zb1 everyone is basically casually an rps account (especially with haobin and a bit of gyubrik) AND a normal fandom account so rps tweets blow up like normal fandom tweets. on top of this, again this is at least in the past it might not be so true now, quite a number of zeroses will be mutuals with solo stans who may as well be this close ü§è to turning into akgaes because it&#x27;s &#x27;not that serious&#x27; or if they&#x27;re a longtime mutual who showed those tendencies in the past it&#x27;s bc of the competitiveness during boys planet and blah blah blah blah so then these solo stans/akgaes very easily get their hands on this stuff and it blows up even more. that&#x27;s just my theory anyway, might not be completely true /+r/156974404591639997</p>

      <p>YUP every public zroses is a casual rpser and tweets referring to ship relationships and the group gayness get clout all the time. I screamed when my friend told me she didn&#x27;t even know they had a cb cuz she didn&#x27;t see tweets about it but she saw the tweets ab yjn unlocking sexuality I was horrified üò≠..
