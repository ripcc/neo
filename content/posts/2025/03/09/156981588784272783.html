      <p>sorry but how and why did gunwook and jiwoong get &#x27;close&#x27; (in quotations bc idk how close they really are) recently like it feels like gunwook is the only member who interacts with jiwoong casually-ish as seen through plus chat and videos (like obviously matthew will do a bit of ppusamz fanservice from time to time but gunwook seems so normal about interacting with him you know). it&#x27;s wild bc jiwoong is such an outcast and has been for so long that it suddenly changing over a year after debut just looks crazy. they have had a few joint schedules but idk, that&#x27;s work and they worked together before anyway in the group so they don&#x27;t gotta do all that</p>
