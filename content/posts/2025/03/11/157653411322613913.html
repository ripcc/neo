      <p>He&#x27;s actually bigger than wooseok. He&#x27;s had lot of hit dramas and his payment is the highest in skorea among actors since 2014/2015. I said this cause I was a big fan of him and this is not shocking at all. I&#x27;ve been feeling weird about kim soo hyun since I read his weird answer in interview and he apparently dated yoona snsd and they broke up because of his personalities /+r/157619667735895442</p>
