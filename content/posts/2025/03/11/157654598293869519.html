      <p>THERE&#x27;S👏NO👏IDOL👏CULTURE👏IN👏CHINA👏😭😭😭 How many times do I have to say this 😭😭😭 They&#x27;ll probably release a Chinese version and that&#x27;s it and perform the Chinese version instead of Korean version when they&#x27;re in China for tmea or tour stops or what ever else they got there. /+r/157621240272736851</p>
