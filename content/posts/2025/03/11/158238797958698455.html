        <p>Random but do you think suga will be able to promote with bts after they comeback? I heard none of them wished him a happy birthday and apparently they haven&#x27;t mentioned him publicly since his dui fiasco, kents want him out of the group but i think bts are too big to care about what they think lol</p>

        <p>im rlly curious to see how itll go bcuz didnt jk and namjoon unfollow e/o? maybe its cuz idk any armys but i feel like the world would move on if they scrapped the group promotions and continued doing solo work lolll. but if theyre rlly thattt money hungry i dont see why not theyre just releasing group stuff for profit so theyll probs continue w suga they dont even go on kent like that</p>
