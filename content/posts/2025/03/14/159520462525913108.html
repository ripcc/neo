      <p>Yeah a bachelors. For people that choose to do the self-study program there&#x27;s 4 course/exams with the last being the comprehensive degree exam. He&#x27;s exempted from the first 3 because of his years at dima. That test day is going to be 6 hours plus an hour lunch.. good luck hanbin. And self-study is hard ðŸ˜­ /+r/159028586890878353</p>
