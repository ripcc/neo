      <p>Okay not gonna lie when I read that I thought anon was reaching with the tie because all black ties looks the same until I watched his pr right now and it&#x27;s distinct with words written on it so did she wear the &#x27;same&#x27; tie with the same words??? AND she said his pr line? *Insert cardi b that&#x27;s suspicious gif /+r/158751350375798266</p>
