        <p>Filafusion is a Chinese owned subsidiary while Fila is Korean owned. Zh&#x27;s ba is marketed in chn, and they&#x27;re trying to grow a Chinese owned brand. Maybe if he were to get Fila it would be kr focused instead??? He&#x27;s a rookie from fuckass wk1, this is huge. He&#x27;s not just friend of house but a brand ambassador! /+r/158738698832403980</p>

      <p>Fusion is new product line of Anta and in any brand, new products are marketed loudly. Team Wang collaborated with fusion before and Fusion&#x27;s endorsers are all big names in C-ent but the executives wanted Hao as their ambassador. Not just someone modeling or attending events but someone who represent the brand and it&#x27;s huge /+r/158747779144045641</p>
