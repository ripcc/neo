      <p>Nah she did go because she put his special stage pc up for sale for a few hundred bucksðŸ˜­ I also checked her weibo after she got posted on twt out of curiosity and she made a weibo post about how you can see her bleached hair color in a bunch of the music show audiences and mcd mc audiences so she definitely goes to stuff. Personally I think she&#x27;s just an obsessive troll who is mostly all talk on the internet I doubt she has the guts to hate on hao to his face but I get why people are mad that she applied to his special stage if she has that history of hating him and was dumb enough to get caught doing it again /+r/158748100125745151</p>
