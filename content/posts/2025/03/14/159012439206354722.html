        <p>Wait I think there actually is a second part to the video coming out. Also hanbin getting jaejoongs personal number was so funny to me like yes let‚Äôs slide a good word in brother üôèüèª I also found it interesting jaejoong himself mentioned how he thinks they are so similar because I always thought it but then finding out they are the same blood type, mbti, from the same province too was funny /+r/158739456483090063</p>
