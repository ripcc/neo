        <p>Kinda agree with you queef. If you looks at the general scope of the group itâ€™s easy to see zh is closer to hb than any other member and it has always been like that, arguably he only even became close to gv because of hb. Whereas hb has always been close to multiple members of the group, like heâ€™s always been close to mtw, always been close to gv since mentioning hugging him the first time they met on bp, even mentions having long late night talks with gw and seems really close too. Itâ€™s not that hb doesnâ€™t value zh as much as zh values hb itâ€™s just hb is a lot obviously closer to more people whereas zh circle is extremely small. Plus like queef said you gotta take these repos with a massive pinch of salt because while I believe they are super close and care for eachother 99% of the repo stuff they say is deffo exaggerated for fs and tbh zh has always been the one to play into fs answers more (regardless of the type of fan) than hb. Like hb does to fs but heâ€™s more reserved about giving away stuff that would be deemed personal info his fs is very much idol surface level fs where zh will just say some crazy stuff ðŸ˜‚ /+r/158743419588664139</p>

      <p>tbh i kind of hate the prev opâ€™s narrative because one thing about hao is he will stand on business like thereâ€™s this whole allin trope that hao loves hanbin like crazy and is obsessed with him meanwhile hanbin dgaf or sees him the same as other close friends but likeeee thatâ€™s just not tru lol theyâ€™re closest to each other ðŸ˜­ y&#x27;all gotta look beyond beyond fansign answers bruh and actually pay attention or better get some inside sources because fansigns no matter what will alwayssss have an element of fanservice (it can be truthful too obviouslyyy but yea) /+r/158750977024021856</p>
