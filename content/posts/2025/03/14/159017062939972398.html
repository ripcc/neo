      <p>variety shows rly dont need the ones who speak the most like a spokesperson i think thats more for talk/radioshows but the most important thing for these varshows is being interesting and having the best comedic timing cuz its the one thats gonna stick to the audience most even hanbin admits that he needs to improve his variety sense more he probably saw the difference in response for salon drip /+r/158739475533617651</p>
