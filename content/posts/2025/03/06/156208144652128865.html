        <p>Why are zeroses blaming solos when the voting score was perfect and the problem was their digitals were too low?? 😭 is there not a single person with a functioning brain in this fandom or are they all sheep and tweet the same thing in different fonts for a hit tweet</p>

      <p>zerose are blaming solos because even though our score was perfect, if even more people voted during pre and live voting gd&#x27;s percentage would have been lower and we could have easily win, it&#x27;s about percentage /+r/156111703636136314</p>
