      <p>no and no the group ending frees majority of them from their mental bind ofc there&#x27;ll be stragglers but akgaes only exist because someone they hates in the same group. and getting excited for haobin later on i highly doubt most of them won&#x27;t even care about either in the next 2 years</p>
