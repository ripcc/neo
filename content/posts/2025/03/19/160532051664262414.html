        <p>i would have understood if they hadn&#x27;t gone on any tour, but they have been on 10+ tour and still haven&#x27;t paid once https://x.com/ctrlglow/status/1901904926734975219?s=19 seriously yuehua should just operate on china, this is the proof cn and kr companies are just the same, both side just mistreat the foreign members</p>

        <p>i just can&#x27;t wrap my head around the fact that they&#x27;ve been promoting for that long and haven&#x27;t seen a dollar.. like esp before they had that hiatus they were pretty active so how did it work ðŸ˜­?? I guess the company provided them with basic necessities but that sounds like a prison sentence and how were they surviving during their hiatus... they&#x27;re probably from fortunate backgrounds but that&#x27;s insane</p>

      <p>Maybe it&#x27;s one of those cases where they had a lot of trainee debt and yuehua was like &quot;you&#x27;ll pay us back with the money you make from your activities&quot;?? everglow debuted in 2019 and were in a 20 month hiatus that ruined their momentum which was yuehua&#x27;s own fault... but it&#x27;s still so weird.

      <p>the thing is everglow were fairly popular and they tour often so I believe they&#x27;ve made the money back + if they&#x27;re mostly from rich families they&#x27;re not accumulating as much debt. I think it&#x27;s just the case of a shitty company that&#x27;s rlly it lmao, my friend told me wannaone had to beg to get paid and look how popular they were</p>
