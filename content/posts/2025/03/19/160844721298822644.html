      <p>do u know if zb1 have ever charted on the billboard 200 in the us? i know they chart a lot in japan so they&#x27;ve reached the billboard charts there but idk about in the us. i assume the way they&#x27;re selling albums in the us now for blue paradise has to be an attempt to make it, especially as the reason u can only order 4 at one time is because apparently more than 4 sales counts as 1 sale or something like that according to billboard</p>
