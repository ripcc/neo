      <p>No you&#x27;re so right idk if this comes off as smth new to her since she&#x27;s been an idol within a more restrictive industry but if you&#x27;re trying to market globally this type of stuff doesn&#x27;t interest anyone ITS BELOW THE BASICS ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like take Olivia Rodrigo for example if we didn&#x27;t know about the Sabrina and Joshua drama driver license wouldn&#x27;t have done neaaaarly as well as it did cuz all she&#x27;d have is being a Disney kid to her name which kinda mirrors the view on kpop idols from the western perspective gjrjngndmdmdmmdks</p>
