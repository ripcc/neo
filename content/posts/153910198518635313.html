        <p>i think i&#x27;ve seen similar engagement for hanbin as well on twitter for salon drip segment and taerae probably had the most engagement this week for his lee mujin. Taerae on lmj makes me realise he could&#x27;ve been the mini lim young woong if he continued his man in love image, cause kfans love his voice. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/153355504381550160">/153355504381550160</a></p>
