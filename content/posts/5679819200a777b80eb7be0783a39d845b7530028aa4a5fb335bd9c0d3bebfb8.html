      <p>her marketing has been all over the place bc she&#x27;s been doing most of her promo w her alt insta with 1m (that was priv for a while) instead of her main with 81m?????and the farthest her marketing has gone is tiktoks and interviews. Somebody get her ass on fallon. And all those interviews are abt her exbf and changing the idol industry by writing her own songs and like nobody outside the kpop sphere is going to care. Ur average person doesn&#x27;t even know that idols aren&#x27;t allowed to date and their only interaction with kpop is dynamite /+r/6b8c8af34c</p>
