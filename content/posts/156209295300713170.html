        <p>i think jwg was also asked by fans because i saw wdgs posting about spamming to him about it on pchat. he probably just answered to their messages. like i know yall hate him here but sometimes yall so detached from reality when it comes to creating theories about him and his behaviour <a href="https://neospring.org<a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/156113164742909305">/156113164742909305</a>">https://neospring.org<a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/156113164742909305">/156113164742909305</a></a></p>
