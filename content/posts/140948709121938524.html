      <p>I mean we all know something was going to stir up there anyway but even if they posted it on Weibo first most the traction and complaints come from international fans anyway not just for this situation but c bars have often used X when wanting to call out the company because logically it’s going to be easier to get their attention here than Weibo regardless of fandom size <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140935745681710293" class="replyLink">/+r/140935745681710293</a></p>
