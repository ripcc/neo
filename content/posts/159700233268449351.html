zh - wouldnâ€™t
hb - likely wouldnâ€™t but i could see a wildcard
mt - would like i wouldnâ€™t be surprised if it happens during the us tour
tr - idk but iâ€™d say he could by association with evnne wakeonez who def would ðŸ˜’
rk - wouldnâ€™t this guyâ€™s asexual atp
gv - i get why people say he would but i donâ€™t see it yet heâ€™s lowkey too rich for that and i only see broke idols do it lmfsooo
gw - could but heâ€™d grow out of considering it quickly
yj - would specifically the cfans </p>
