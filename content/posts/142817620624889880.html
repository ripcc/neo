        <p>I went through some haobinist neos to find tea abt the other members but i ended up reading the haobin gossip and why aren&#x27;t they treated like jiwoong when the gp found out abt his gf? They have a crazy amount of rumors and i read that all the staff that&#x27;s worked with jebis since the debut goes around saying that they must be dating. So i was just wondering why the kfans don&#x27;t hate them...</p>
