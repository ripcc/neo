      <p>Yeah idk who told you that but I&#x27;ve met my fair share of east Asian wackers and all of them have been either women or gay men like I&#x27;ve never ever seen a straight male wacker and when I did used to dance it was in Singapore so almost all east Asian dancers
Hanbin is most definitely gay for more reasons than that, like to the point that if he ever popped out with a wife I&#x27;d be assuming he&#x27;s fucking guys on the dl not even that he&#x27;s bi or somey</p>
