        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/tttopazz/status/1880544231720353921?s=46">https://twitter.com/tttopazz/status/1880544231720353921?s=46</a> i dont know what type of a beef ricky has with yuehua but it must be DEEP AF. as we all know yuehua has hands on/people working inside wakeone. yuehua ch literally controls weibo on the entertainment side. seeing this is kinda crazy. like i knew yuehua ch disliked ricky for some reason but this is crazy ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ of cours riyangis blame wakeone for this but wakeone has got nothing to do with weibo or c-ent even if dispatch is a korean firm</p>
