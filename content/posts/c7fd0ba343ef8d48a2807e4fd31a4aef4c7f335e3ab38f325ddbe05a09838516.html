      <p>people keep suggesting that he run for president but they don&#x27;t understand how much aversion I have to voting for a psychotic white liberal, white liberals in general are major red flags especially when they craft their image around poc because I&#x27;ve heard some gossip from people in politics and a lot of them are grifters</p>

      <p>No I get you there&#x27;s a secret evil about white liberals that&#x27;s so unsettling but honestly I can take that over a cult conservative leader damn we are actually finished out here we&#x27;re never getting a president for the people</p>
