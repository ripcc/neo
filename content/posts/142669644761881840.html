For small and mid tier companies they have to outsource compared to big4 where they already have in house choreographers and producers like YG has their own dance crew (ygx), their own producers (teddy before he moved on to tbl), SM has kenzie and whole bootcamps dedicated to make music for their groups and has strong ties with people like bada to make iconic memorable choreo for their groups, hybe is hybe they have a whole ecosystem, idk much about jype but it&#x27;s probably the same for them too jyp himself used to make music for his groups but he stopped </p>
