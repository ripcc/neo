        <p>getting into &amp;team and their bond is so wholesome this could have been zb1 if they fandom wasn&#x27;t ruined by dumbass solo fans and some.. shady member moments sometimes ðŸ˜ž in their reality show they had to pick the least fashionable member and the member who got picked was visibly upset so the members apologised and comforted him and the comments all called out the company for making them do this because it&#x27;s rude and I was just thinking like &quot;damn zb1 does this to each other unprovoked all the time ðŸ˜­&quot;</p>
