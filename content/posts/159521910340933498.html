        <p>girl fila fusion has been around for awhile. they are not doing more or less than haos other ambassadorships. i really dont like this one because it just makes no sense for hao and its a money grab. all the other amabassadors had these huge marketing campaigns going on for them but with hao they simply do a buy as much as you can and attend a fan meeting with hao typa thing. you seriously can not tell me this benefits hao in any typa way other than making money. people are not going to look up his name when they see his pic in the store. nobody does that shit in china. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/158752566338082577" class="replyLink">/+r/158752566338082577</a></p>

      <p>brand deals really dont do that much for the artist promotion wise but doing them is important to upkeep market value the industry is always checking who&#x27;s selling and who has strong buying power endorsements and brand deals are the most lucrative things a celebrity can do <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/159012594559177399" class="replyLink">/+r/159012594559177399</a></p>
