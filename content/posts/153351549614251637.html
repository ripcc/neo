        <p>Why do people celebrate the sales when the result for each comeback is stagnant... There is no growth at all, reflecting they can&#x27;t attract new fans that much. Even the poca market in korea is not massive anymore. The fandom hates it when haters called them out about caring about ships more than talent, but they do promote ships first when someone is interested in the group. What I hate the most is this fandom vibes totally match SM 2nd gen bgs fandom, a bunch of lazy ass thinking the mistreated ones are getting more and the loved ones are getting mistreatment, the highest worshipper of ships and visuals not talent nor music</p>
