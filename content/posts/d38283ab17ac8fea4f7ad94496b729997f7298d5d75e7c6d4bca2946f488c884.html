      <p>It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t wanna recreate another hao that&#x27;s the whole purpose because he&#x27;s def not renewing and any company would go above and beyond to get an idol who generates insane profit like he does there&#x27;s currently no other 4th/5th gen idol with his selling power in the chinese market, it&#x27;s more like they don&#x27;t want chinese trainees to ever overshadow korean ones or get too popular to the point of winning p01 again (which was obviously not on cj&#x27;s plans) but they wanna use them to make profit and get into the cb market (which is also silly because they don&#x27;t have a label there like they do for japan and they don&#x27;t know shit about how it operates) so as much as they&#x27;ll try to do that I feel like they&#x27;ll also be severe with their sabotage of the chinese trainees like the comparisons and the xenophobia are about to be rabid lol <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/40a9c870ea" class="replyLink">/+r/40a9c870ea</a></p>

      <p>Of course I mean that was still the case before hao he&#x27;s just the exception if it was really up to mnet they wouldn&#x27;t have let him get p01 if they knew but with the progression of zb1 they&#x27;re obv trying to get that money from china too. They&#x27;re gonna be severe yea the way their screentime favoritism was so BLATANT it&#x27;s about to be 10x more jarring</p>
