        <p>Tbh they only did 1 Japan release in 2024 at the beginning of the year and they already did a Japanese album at the beginning of this year so I canâ€™t see them doing another one. With fancon tour and award season Iâ€™d say we will probably have a summer comeback and then maybe a final single or full length album in December as a goodbye like what kepi was doing with thereâ€™s before 7 of them extended and then final concerts mid Jan <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/157619680771792020" class="replyLink">/+r/157619680771792020</a></p>

      <p>i&#x27;m like 75% sure that japanese album was supposed to come out the end of last year that&#x27;s why all those fansigns got postponed to january. unfortunately they&#x27;ll definitely do another jp release and then an arena or dome tour <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/157653384697174763" class="replyLink">/+r/157653384697174763</a></p>
