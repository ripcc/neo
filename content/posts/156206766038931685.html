        <p>i&#x27;m the og anon, it&#x27;s not schedules wise, people are trying to argue they&#x27;re &#x27;pushed&#x27; as a ship/duo via all the fanservice they&#x27;re doing and are a government ship. for example they said it was unnatural when gunwook kissed matthew&#x27;s hand in that one live ðŸ˜­ but like.. it doesn&#x27;t seem that crazy idk they&#x27;re doing too much. judging by the woongdeongie state round those parts i theorise that they or the others chiming in might be a bitter ppusamz enjoyer since they haven&#x27;t really interacted in a million years <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/155537419024947150" class="replyLink">/+r/155537419024947150</a></p>

      <p>it would be fanservice if they only did it for the cameras and it has already been shown multiple times and photoed by ssngs that they are like two pieces of gum stuck together even the members say they are sick of them <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/156102890375828467" class="replyLink">/+r/156102890375828467</a></p>
