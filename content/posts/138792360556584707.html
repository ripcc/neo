      <p>hold on if zb1 are in thailand while prezent comes out does that mean they&#x27;re doing hardly any japan promo which means the korean promo could be better than the past few eras??????? i hope that&#x27;s the case bc it&#x27;s been so doom and gloom lately like with the way everything&#x27;s been so solo, less ot9 focused i&#x27;ve been thinking this will be the first era without a 2d1n series but if they do more group content (or even just content in general like i&#x27;ll take multiple units over solo stuff) then GOOD.. and if the thailand visit is fr for filming 2d1n then even better</p>
