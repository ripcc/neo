      <p>i wonder how the floormates were chosen like were they even allowed to give any input? did they vote on who would get to be in the new hao2binz floor? did taerae and gunwook request to stay on their floor? did yujin choose to be gunrae’s new floormate? etc. Ugh being nosy is a curse i’m dying over here</p>

      <p>same I think gyhabn obv chose each other I guess matty rky just stayed where they were and maybe yj decided to move up cuz he&#x27;s close with gwk maybe? I&#x27;m assuming the manager lives downstairs and not up so yjn would&#x27;ve probably had to share if he stayed there so he came up and tartar let him have a big room that&#x27;s just how I see it gwk also probably just wanted to keep his room</p>
