      <p>sis you can say us it&#x27;s ok. personally I never said they&#x27;re dead as friends I just felt like they&#x27;ve drifted they had potential to be each others #1s at some point but that&#x27;s definitely never happening. And are you saying you don&#x27;t know more or we don&#x27;t know more? I can&#x27;t think of recent gyuwook sightings anyways the most recent one was a 2binz one no?</p>
