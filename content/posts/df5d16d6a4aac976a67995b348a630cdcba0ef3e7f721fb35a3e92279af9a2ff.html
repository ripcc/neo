      <p>mnet likes to wait a year between shows so a year after iland2 finale would be july 2025 that means a new group debut is at the end of 2025 and that&#x27;s the last months of zb1s contract</p>

      <p>Kepler getting all that time I&#x27;m sorry they gotta die. The groups debut time isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m really thinking about it&#x27;s the air time and the looming threat of zb1s involvement</p>
