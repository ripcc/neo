        <p>omgggggggg this reminds me of in the gda zepisode from a few days ago, i could hear matthew talking in english while they were all sitting around eating and i wanted to know wtf he was saying (actually just checked bc of this ask lmao it was at 12:21 and he was saying to ricky &quot;i&#x27;m actually like really ????&quot; and it&#x27;s probably not a big deal, maybe he said something like hot, but i&#x27;m so nosy bc what else was he talking about let me in lmao) but you can&#x27;t hear bc of members talking. i remember when i was a carat i was watching this behind the scenes video of them at the james corden show and you could hear joshua in the back talking to someone in english and the only words i could make out is when it sounded like he said &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; at one point so from then on i&#x27;ve always been ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ when hearing idols talk in the back of videos <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/143761890907214563">/143761890907214563</a></p>
