      <p>well you can assume martial law would let crazy shit fly they could do mass ticket cancellations they could revoke shorter visas and force people to leave they could do a lot of things but foreigners aren&#x27;t the focus this was called under the guise of eradicating &quot;North Korean elements&quot; it was just to fuck over anyone who opposes him you can just assume literally anyone that&#x27;s not a man or a conservative would be at risk</p>
