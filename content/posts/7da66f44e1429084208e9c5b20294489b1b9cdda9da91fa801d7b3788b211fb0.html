      <p>yes they did but they just made fun of him in general for not participating in what they do that doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s never drank they were A1 shitty friends tho he&#x27;s cut them off but they&#x27;re not why he likes being alone he&#x27;s just like that. And most American teens just drink whether it be with family or friends or party and its beeeeen rumored they obviously delved into deeper stuff and drugs that he didn&#x27;t like regardless the story with gyuvins friend just can&#x27;t be true mi nuh care</p>
