        <p>I think itâ€™s actually outside of wk1 because i remember he used to go to a language teacher before bp and even gave the teacher a signed album after <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/151040899579862728" class="replyLink">/+r/151040899579862728</a></p>

      <p>its more likely imo its just convenient and it would place them on the same learning track like we can say what we want ab wkn but this is pretty basic accomm. i just dont feel like theyd be given the task to find their own lang teachers when its an important part of the job</p>
