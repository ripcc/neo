this is just untrue. first of all, it&#x27;s almost impossible for her to actually &quot;take over&quot; the company by getting more than 50% of the stake. the court ruled that this plan had never actually gone into effect even though there may have been intent. but doesn&#x27;t intent really mean anything if it&#x27;s completely unachievable? yeah, she can get people to buy stocks and slightly lessen hybe&#x27;s influence but she can&#x27;t &quot;take over the company&quot; or whatever bullshit. it&#x27;s just an excuse for hybe retaliating against her after she submitted that internal report and it was a convenient reason for them to have the upper hand in the media buy opening a case against her first.</p>
