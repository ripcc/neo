        <p>yo imagine this. gunwook, ricky and hanbin redebuting together in hbs company with an r&amp;b sound... hbs def going for something like that. i put ricky into the mix cause i feel like yuehua is not keen on him and ngl he doesnt seem to be either ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ i just really want updates from gunwook and ricky after disbandment ðŸ˜­ bitches like jellyfish and yuehua would never (or once every full moon) which is the worst thing to do unless you are a female idol, from the big3 or debut with a song like eleven</p>
