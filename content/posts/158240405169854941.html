        <p>I read that the reason she suddenly posted that couple picture was because she was desperate for him to contact her because apparently he helped with her debt (from the car accident) and never mentioned anything about needing her to pay him/his company back back then but then suddenly this year (I think) he/ his company told her to pay back all the debt like ofc she cant, she cant even get a part time job because ppl recognize her/ her name and dont want to associate with her so she even tried changing her legal name... i just feel so bad she must&#x27;ve been so desperate but when she posted that pic all she got was more hate and slut shamed and idt he ever contacted her either... <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/157619667735895442" class="replyLink">/+r/157619667735895442</a></p>
