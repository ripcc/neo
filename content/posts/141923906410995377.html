        <p>i only miss broadcast photocards and some cinema paradise pobs. for broadcast pc, some cn sellers sold his for less than $20, if you are lucky you might get your hand on it. the tricky part is some sellers don&#x27;t wanna sell to foreigner and we need to make sure to get proof vid, just in case it is a dupe. but the dupe case is rare if it is a trusted seller based on testimony. once i got 10 of his pobs for less than $80, even one of his most wanted like the white bunny is less than $10 at some seller. try it once and you will never stop, that place is collector gpds&#x27; heaven fr. or you can just find a fellow collector in the same region to split the shipping cost, sometimes cn sellers got more than 1 members it is a win too <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/140891112759054645" class="replyLink">/+r/140891112759054645</a></p>
