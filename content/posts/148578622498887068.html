        <p>Yeqh basically chronic dry eyes where eye drops don&#x27;t do anything anymore, it&#x27;s so uncomfortable and even painful. My bro got Lasik and he regrets it so bad cuz dry eyes is one if the side effects. Rk also prob so busy ain&#x27;t getting no sleep plus always having to wear makeup so prob irritated him even more since japan. He said on pchat he went to the doctor yesterday so that&#x27;s good and idk riyangis mad saying wk1 won&#x27;t let him go to the doctor and shit. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/148353337379740815">/148353337379740815</a></p>

        <p>no like people actually commit suicide over those kinds of complications so i get the concern but of course it has to get mixed with unnecessary bullshit. his schedule and routine is def worsening it but its still concerning that he has to rely this heavily on drops at 20 but glad hes got it checked</p>

      <p>part of the problem was the drops he was using before nazorin restricts the blood vessels to get rid of redness so if its used frequently over time you basically become dependent on it and cant naturally produce tears well so im happy he got eye drops from the doctor apparently the type he got made w his own blood is really effective but expensive <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/148359539513841725">/148359539513841725</a></p>
