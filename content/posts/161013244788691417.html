      <p>its not racist its just obvious different groups of fans act different like seasian fans have their own brand, eu fans, latam fans ghjkwjghjfk ea fans have their stark differences where they expect to be treated like royalty but icl theyre all a little diff to me. krn fans have the ultimate entitlement which i understand theyre the heart of kpop groups, jfans are always the better treated fans that groups end up gravitating towards since they complain minimally support everyone and keep shit hush hush, and cfans are usually the more criticized theyre usually typed as rich sasaengy and invasive</p>
