      <p>omg they enabled a scrolling view but if you add ?page=X (whatever number of page you want) to the end of your url you can still easily skip to older asks!! elaborate in baby words i donâ€™t get what anon is saying ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>There didn&#x27;t used to be an infinite scroll it was a strict 25 ask per page sitch so going back and forth reading asks on here your urls would look like this for example https://neospring.org/@requeefiem?page=20 which takes you back it&#x27;s not dated but it helps with going back to old asks unlike cc where there was only an infinite scroll and if you wanted to find something old you&#x27;d have to sit there and move your fingers for however long</p>
