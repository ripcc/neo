      <p>There didn&#x27;t used to be an infinite scroll it was a strict 25 ask per page sitch so going back and forth reading asks on here your urls would look like this for example <a href="https://neospring.org/@requeefiem?page=20">https://neospring.org/@requeefiem?page=20</a> which takes you back it&#x27;s not dated but it helps with going back to old asks unlike cc where there was only an infinite scroll and if you wanted to find something old you&#x27;d have to sit there and move your fingers for however long</p>
