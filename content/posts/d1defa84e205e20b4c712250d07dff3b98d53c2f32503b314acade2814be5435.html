      <p><a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/d72845fadc" class="replyLink">/+r/d72845fadc</a>Ok yeah that&#x27;s what I thought because I remember once or twice upper floor members coming in the dorm through the downstairs floor so the dorm was connected like this and haobin current rooms look bigger while even though Gyuvins seem to be a bit smaller it&#x27;s still larger than Taerae it still is probably in the same apartment complex tho I wonder how this happened</p>
