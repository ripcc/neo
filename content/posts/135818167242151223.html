        <p>Most shippers don‚Äôt like them equally and that‚Äôs just a fact and it‚Äôs like that for every single ship out there in existence, there will always be an individual preference for one over the other. In our case the unique thing is once they disband it will become really clear whose peoples number 1 was because that‚Äôs ultimately the one they will keep up with more. Until then there will always be rosins saying haobinist don‚Äôt care about hao and allins saying haobinist don‚Äôt care about hanbin. Fact of the matter is only a few will truly care about both equally and some will care more for hao and some more for hanbin and they can‚Äôt control or change that or even get them to drop the ship to focus on their fave like they want because that‚Äôs not and never been how shipping works. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/135785348893726748">/135785348893726748</a></p>

        <p>THANK YOUUUUUU it&#x27;s annoying when people say so and so only care about ____ well it&#x27;s two people in a pair the majority almost never care about the two equally ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and there&#x27;s no overwhelming majority of alln or rsin jaobinists so it&#x27;s stupid to keep dwelling on</p>

      <p>Hmmm I kind of agree with anon except that hao def has it worse I mean I only ever see him get heat for interacting with other members/idols who aren&#x27;t hanbin and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of stereotypes about gay men / homophobia but I never see the same energy with hanbin even though he interacts with many more people so yeah there&#x27;s definitely a noticable difference in how they&#x27;re treated by shippers, this can be noticed even with intl fans too every interaction hao has with a male idol has to have 37378228 analysis but of course you can&#x27;t deny that shippers will almost always have a bias and that&#x27;s just what shipping is i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily a bad thing but it becomes weird when you only care about one and think of the other as some tool for your fantasies <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/135788423863819333">/135788423863819333</a></p>
