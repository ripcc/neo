        <p>the situations are totally different tho like jw living outside the dorm with his gf actually affected the group dynamic, that plus haobin basically have plausible deniability unless something concrete leaks bc a lot of kfans probably donâ€™t believe they could be gay and the ones that do are fujoshis lmao /+r/142797210365678625</p>

      <p>Absolutely not and the group would&#x27;ve been met with an early disbandment</p>
