Well you have to consider his dad isn&#x27;t your typical dad either. From what we know I just think of his dad as that stereotypical kdrama CEO dad (idk if he&#x27;s ceo but he&#x27;s gotta be up around there) who&#x27;s always away for business and comes home once every couple months while his wife and kids live comfortably in a mansion so naturally the mom is closer with the kids but doesn&#x27;t mean the dad doesn&#x27;t love them, he&#x27;s just busy working so his family can live comfortably and that&#x27;s his way of love even though it sacrifices bonding time since I&#x27;m pretty sure his business is in Vegas. So they&#x27;re probably not as close as other father son but he probably loves them just like any other father. They just live in a different world and I don&#x27;t think we can say what&#x27;s love and what&#x27;s not love 🤷🏾‍♀️</p>

      <p>i think their dad loves the duh but regardless of class an absent parent isnt gonna have a strong relationship with their kids thats just how it is im sure if work wasnt a thing maybe the circumstances would be different but it doesnt change whats the case now ultimately i dont think he has a bad relationship with his dad and thats whats it important. but it speaks volumes that people theorized that ricky was fatherless 😭😭😭 their dads working to maintain their life so i get it they probably do too</p>
