      <p>i&#x27;m an allin and i&#x27;ve been your cc/ns reader for months so I&#x27;m used to your moment of hating hb lmao but genuinely asking why are you irked by hanbin so much? beside of allins behavior. is it just bc of his fans or him as a person?? bc from my perspective he&#x27;s a lovely boy who has a really good personality (ofc my pov bc i&#x27;m his fan)</p>

      <p>...I feel like because he&#x27;s your bias it just feels more personal to you because I don&#x27;t ever say anything out of the blue and keep it to a snarky level if I&#x27;m feeling cheeky not to mention I have dogged on members I actually do like way more than him. I&#x27;ve probably said it a hundred times but it&#x27;s literally just allins hanbin has always been someone I don&#x27;t rlly care for so if his fans are upsetting me well there&#x27;s your answer and one thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that people think not caring = hate it doesn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t hate hanbin and a good day we can gwan sometimes! I give it to other members a lot more than him certain fans just like to zero in like this isn&#x27;t just my personality half the time I&#x27;ve been transparent about being a troll so ur getting what u ordered ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
