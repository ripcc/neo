      <p>also another con about tumblr is that if you deactivate your posts will dissapear except for the ones people reposted. those stay on the internet forever as reposts on their accs.</p>

      <p>yea I&#x27;ve had a lot of old blogs I like disappear and only the reposts are left but tbh I don&#x27;t mind I would probably end up leaving my stuff up forever if i abandoned instead of deactivating</p>
