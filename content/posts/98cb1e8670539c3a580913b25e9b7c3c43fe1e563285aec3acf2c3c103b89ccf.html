      <p>Like queef said it’s always been a thing for election day but it’s so stupid to use it in this context because it’s not about voting a political party in its the country protesting against the president the colour has nothing to do with it and if you look at protest pics many signs and stuff are written in red and people are still wearing red. This came as the result of martial law a situation no one saw coming nor knows how to deal with so why would anyone have the foresight not to wear red when tbh in that situation what colour they wear is probably the last thing on their mind. /+r/b9c9fd58c5</p>
