      <p>True but irrc this is when wakeone was using a lot of in-house producers it might be different when they are external sourcing especially since kenzie seems involved in all aspects this time around <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/147017850446634925" class="replyLink">/+r/147017850446634925</a></p>
