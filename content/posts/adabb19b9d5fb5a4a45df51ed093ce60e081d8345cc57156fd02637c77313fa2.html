      <p>yeah I think its a side profile thing cause she doesn&#x27;t look much diff from the front and it looks like she filled it at the top of her chin like right below her lip. but why tho ðŸ˜­ her chin was perfectly fine two weeks ago (I actually noticed she got her chin filled during the rolarola event a week ago but wasnt sure until I saw her side profile at the airport when she left for miumiu). she always had a projected chin too but now it&#x27;s even more where it looks like a crescent moon... wony pls dissolve it asapppppppppp</p>

      <p>like sissss her chin looks fat its probably squishy and if it does nothing to the front its useless imo if you have a decently projected tzone area thats the most important for a side profile chin jaw area is secondary WONY PLEEKKKKKK</p>
