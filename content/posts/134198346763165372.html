        <p>눈오리는 많이 만들수록 좋습니다, 화단에 엄청 깔아두세요 그럼 다음날 아침에, 일어나서 가보면 없을거에요 저같은 친구들이 다, 망가뜨려 놓기때문에. Basically saying the more snow ducks you make the better, in fact make an entire flower bed full of them. Then next morning when you wake up (excited to see all your snow ducks) it won&#x27;t be there because a friend like me is gonna smash them all 😭 I don&#x27;t even know why he said that, some people said someone asked him on live how to build a snow duck or something and he replied with that 😭 but yeah snow ducks are basically snow. ducks. ASDFSEAKFJSA;KJFA;S and it&#x27;s really popular in Korea, a lot of kids, teens and even adults make them on the way home and you can find snow duck molds in every convenient store also the wording he used he just sounds like a typical uneducated hannam incel so they&#x27;re also jumping him for that. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/134019602014492205">/134019602014492205</a></p>

      <p>For more context, my Korean friend said Korea is depressing af ASKFJSLAKDFHASL;FH so when they go to school/ work or going home from evening tutor sessions/ un paid overtime that seeing these snow ducks randomly brings little joys to them 😭 <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/134024236506503379">/134024236506503379</a></p>
