        <p>why are rosins crying nd throwing up about now or never parts... zh had great screentime and lines on this song when you consider the fact that the group has 8 other members 😂😂 what are these people expecting? he is in a group. i already saw a few eyeing gunwooks lines 💀 like pls stay away from japans king. some are trying to push the yuehuaz got no lines and the new wakeonez hogged all the lines thing... well guess what? only 1 out of the yuehuaz can hold a note without falling into a coughing fit afterwards and that person already has alot of lines in the song so i really dont know what they are trying to do</p>
