        <p><a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/139031033403366205" class="replyLink">/+r/139031033403366205</a>i think its cause duhua was excluding ricky out from things whenever she talked about &quot;her&quot; achievements. i could be wrong tho 🙏 from what we know ricky is also never with the others when they go out and eat with the staff. ricky also seems to keep mostly to himself and not contact the evnne guys like gyuvin does, if ricky did we would hear about it from the evnne guys but they have almost never mentioned him during this one year... just very weird </p>
