      <p>the reason big kpop groups aren&#x27;t as influential as they used to be and groups struggle to really breakout is because youtube is dying and nobody watches music videos anymore, meanwhile tiktok is very fickle and pretty much only easy-listening songs that have the right format and aesthetic that is usable for tiktok content get big there</p>

      <p>yuppp youtube streaming cultures died and a good music video cant help your career anymore just seeing how successful 5050 was able to get with tiktok carrying their song tells us all we need to know but its actually so hard to achieve a hit from that cuz the algorithms so picky</p>
