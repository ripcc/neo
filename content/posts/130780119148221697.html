      <p>It&#x27;s getting hard to ignore how terrible Wakeone is at managing them when their youtube views are faltering so badly on all of these year end videos compared to other groups. Izna&#x27;s fans also have the same sentiment about lackluster stage planning. There&#x27;s no way they don&#x27;t know about the complaints but they&#x27;re just not ever going to put in any effort or investment into their groups and I think it&#x27;s time to accept it. I know that the fandom having a negative mindset makes it worse though so my resolution for 2025 is to stop having expectations, simply pray for miracles to happen, and promote them as if they&#x27;re nugu and have no street cred at all.</p>
