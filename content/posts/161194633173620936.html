      <p>I think company and idols are more mutual than company and staff. Like, the staff is working for the company and idols.

      <p>Yea I get your point the public reaction was basically the same saying how can a celeb be included in the same bracket as people who work minimum wage just to make livings. Which I understand but it also just puts children at risk when they&#x27;re placed in these ambiguous boxes since that&#x27;s what a lot of these idols are. I don&#x27;t totally disagree with it but it&#x27;s just jarring to hear especially when it was case of a company abusing their power</p>
