      <p>Anon he said 习惯就好 which is literally &quot;habit/used to it then good&quot; can either mean &quot;if you get used to it then it&#x27;s okay&quot; OR &quot;best to get used to it&quot; he either saying once they listen to it a few times and get used to it it&#x27;s okay OR fans should get used to less lines, it&#x27;s up to your interpretation</p>
