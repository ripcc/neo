        <p>not any of these anons and this is my weekly neo visit so I was scrolling like usual reading the newspaper and saw u said to dead the convo in another ask but I just saw this thread and checked her xhs and she uploaded a new recent rk fansign i have to talk about it im dyinggg so im sorry for bringing her up again ðŸ˜­ <a href="http://xhslink.com/a/fQOINWkGyk17">http://xhslink.com/a/fQOINWkGyk17</a> caption &#x27;congratulations you wasted another minute, you (rk) have such a boring signing conversation&#x27; ðŸ˜­ i googled the translations it was basically rk- long time no see. s-it hasnt been long. rk- oh a few days? 4 days? s-i went back to china. r- oh nice. gives costume r- oh bullet proof vest is cool. s- u look handsome today. rk- u look pretty today too. s- i cant stand it. r- cant stand what? s- i just cant stand it imma stop talking. random useless chatting r- ur friend asked me to give u a hair color recommendation. s- well what color? r- any color looks good, the color now looks good. s- ill change to a more explosive color next time (im assuming she was annoyed because he didnt rec a color to her) r. no need now is fine. ðŸ˜­ i cantttttt ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€ I feel like rk will never give her the type of attention she wants like mt because the damage is done it&#x27;s strictly friendly now none of that gf stan stuff and i get it like if i were him i am not feeding into that master roleplay bs so im glad he has strict boundaries and doesnt forget when someone crosses it and i think she knows it too. honestly mt needs to chill a bit with her i think i found her douyin because the angles are the same and omfg hes crazyyyyy ðŸ˜­ <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/159538948086124865" class="replyLink">/+r/159538948086124865</a></p>
