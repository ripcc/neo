      <p>Diff anon I was just going to send an ask about this I guess it hasn&#x27;t made to the intl side but Yeonjun made a joke/mentioned Xi&#x27;s name on Amazing Saturday which is like a big nono I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal but apparently it&#x27;s so bad that worst case scenario the group could be banned from promoting in China if it blows up, the twitter searches for his Chinese name are so insane because all the Chinese kpop fans literally cannot talk about it on Chinese apps they&#x27;ll get censored and stuff will get deleted so they&#x27;re all cursing him on twitter instead</p>
