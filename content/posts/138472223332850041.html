      <p>Iâ€™m the one that sent that bug list of yujins mc schedules but since Iâ€™m still petty let me add on that  on the 28/07/24 the day of kcon LA inkigayo was cancelled, 15/09/24 when zb1 went to krazy inkigayo was cancelled. In fact since Yujin became mc they cancelled their own show 11 times in 2024 and out of the 21 times he missed inkigayo in 2024 11 of them were because the show was cancelled, 7 because of tour, 2 because of festivals and other music stages, 1 because of a fan event. This actually makes me realise that most the reason inkigayo probably donâ€™t keep MCs for more than a year is probably because the weekend is the worst days to mc because anything of importance going on will more than likely be happening at the weekend</p>
