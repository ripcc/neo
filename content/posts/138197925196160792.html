      <p>idk if anyone else noticed bc hardly anyone watches them and especially not right on the dot when they come out but i noticed in the music bank japan zepisode from a few days ago when it first came out for the last bit when gunwook was talking onwards they inserted subtitles from a completely different (probably unreleased because i don&#x27;t remember the subs being in anything else, but if they have been then i guess that might go against what i&#x27;m trying to say lmao) video. like it was clearly subbing gyuvin and hanbin talking about harry potter or something like nothing lined up with what was happening in the video and i thought i was going crazy, or thinking maybe they were subbing a conversation that was happening in the back of the video since you could hear members talking as well, so i went to rewatch it yesterday to see if the video had been fixed and the subs were corrected to gw talking about eating his food and then the other following scenes of the video ðŸ˜­ but the main point i&#x27;m trying to make is that i wonder how they decide when to upload zepisodes and all that bc it seems so random and sometimes we are in huge droughts so i&#x27;m like ??? i&#x27;m sure now we must have quite a few for past schedules coming up but nothing was uploaded today and the members aren&#x27;t doing shit (at least publicly, i know they&#x27;re preparing for 2 comebacks lmao) so idk i just wonder if their upload schedule is okay or should be more frequent, less random. obviously they shouldn&#x27;t upload every single day so they end up running out but like this video where gv and hb are talking about whatever still isn&#x27;t out 4 days after we have proof that a whole other video has already been translated/subbed (unless it&#x27;s for that gayo that hasn&#x27;t aired yet, in which case that actually makes sense as to why it hasn&#x27;t been uploaded) also what was funny is that when hb was in the hybe building to rehearse with tws and nssign for his special stage they accidentally said he was in the sm building in the subs ðŸ˜­ idk if that bit was fixed tho</p>
