      <p>yea his ex came out with the news very recently and the abuse was happening as recent as the pandemic it got to the point his label thought he couldve killed her it was that bad but she said hes been dealing with depression and substance abuse and alcohol already so tbh i think even if he did jump i doubt it was a sober decision but i can see it being a reckless accident too</p>
