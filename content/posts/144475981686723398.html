        <p>top instiz article rn with 20k views is about zb1 someone posted how they have been interested with an idol who stands out, sings live and dances well and everyone was guessing since midnight so it was trending then op revealed that it was hao and it got positive responses up until now idk what happened but it seemed like other sfs got offended because the post seem like its shading other zb1 members? now its marked as marple bc they kept fighting on the comments and non fans are just saying that the fandom atmosphere is rly bad and zeroses look crazy ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
