      <p>Are there any hints of them singing the song? Bc Itzy released a song called &quot;weapon&quot; for street girls fighter and ngl the song was good and at the time it was one of their better releases bc it was during their sneakers era, but the song was too high for all of them, and although the choreo was also great they never performed it live either. There&#x27;s only clips of the dance line dancing to it on vlive. off anon</p>

      <p>oh do you mean like them possible performing it? tbh no I don&#x27;t think they will especially cuz it was a surprise that no one could predict + show isn&#x27;t that big idk if it&#x27;s mnet so if it&#x27;s not there&#x27;s less of an obligation to. But im sure the members will sing it on live or smth like that but an actual performance i dont see it happening</p>
