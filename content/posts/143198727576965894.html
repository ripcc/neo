        <p>this is my dark past but i wanna share a bit. back then when i stan another group i join this gc which gathered by someone who has connection with crazies out there, they literally got photos of members in the middle of their date and everyone be hunting for poor girl instagram along with the idol&#x27;s private to judge if they will create problem in the future. of course there are fansites in it together, some of them will be the one &#x27;responsible&#x27; to warn them directly on fansigns. idk how they did it maybe silent treatments are actually organized by them to show protest? these fans are not that crazy about their idol dating if they are being careful and being &#x27;considerate&#x27; not being seen on public too much. in some cases idols starting to post lovestagram or showing hints by wearing couple items publicly etc, their &#x27;fans&#x27; usually warn them several times to tone it down. if they already get the warning but still being stubborn to do it, these &#x27;fans&#x27; will spill everything when &#x27;normal fans&#x27; started to notice and blow it up on online community. something like &#x27;i told you to tone it down, now others are noticing, it is all your fault that we spill everything&#x27;. e.g. gyuvin&#x27;s case, none of his fans really bring it up to him until lately despite his relationship has been that long. maybe sightings of him and his gf are deemed too frequent some couple months before they end their relationship that fans started to scold him. when i think about it, i must&#x27;ve lost my mind for joining such gc back then but if the pattern is the same for all idols, maybe jw was dating like a normal person not like an idol that&#x27;s why he was losing fans? <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/142821609668040329">/142821609668040329</a></p>

        <p>hdjenfnfmmfkdkdk u better than me I would&#x27;ve been hopping those gcs but ofc fans getting mad at him is one thing and I think what u said applies to most idols but it&#x27;s just a situation not comparable to what anons asking</p>
