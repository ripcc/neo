        <p>diff anon but the airport got shat on from every country for their stupid ass layout like who the fuck puts a cement wall at the end of the runway? if the plane kept sliding until it stopped on its own everyone probably wouldve survived /+r/140952290910754065</p>

        <p>That as well I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a normal thing but I don&#x27;t get how that was supposed to be a safety mechanism like at all</p>

      <p>even tho i know nothing bout plane i know that def aint normal ðŸ˜­ I think the day when it happened I read how the things at the end were like some sorta antenna typa thing so the airplanes can lock onto the runway and theyre made out of metal bars so if a plane crashes into it the mental bars break apart and the plane can continue sliding but for some reason jeju airport needed to make those antennas higher so they put them on top of a cement wall hill thing ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ /+r/140954062563793582</p>
