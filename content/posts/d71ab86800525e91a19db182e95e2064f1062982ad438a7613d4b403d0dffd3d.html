      <p>uhm obviously a bunch of unconfirmed rumors got swirled in I can&#x27;t rmbr fully but she literally had a level 4 punishment for the shit she would do at school which is severe and Korean schooling already brushes off a lot of bullying not to mention the shit she&#x27;d say online and write in her classrooms that was 100% her ðŸ˜­</p>
