      <p>I&#x27;ll list it out by member jiwoong - go enlist brudda
hao - tbh my wish is lowkey him being a soloist in korea but that&#x27;s near impossible a group is aight but i think it would more be fun exploring his sound
hanbin - not in a group or a soloist I think he should pursue dance and stay within in that mc presenter realm I don&#x27;t think he suits variety but some kind of YouTube show idk
matthew - I&#x27;d want to see him in a group again I don&#x27;t rlly see much when it comes to his future besides being in a group but my ideal would be redebuting with gunwook üòù
taerae - I don&#x27;t think he should go solo yet I think about it and it could work but also I guess my dislike for evnne runs deep I wouldn&#x27;t wish that on him but he&#x27;s most likely going there. but if that sm trot group does well let&#x27;s put him in the next one
ricky - I can see him being independent and trying to break into that social media and fashion world but I&#x27;m a fan and I&#x27;m selfish but also debuting in a group is iffy the only possibility I can think of is yuehuaz and well there&#x27;s been no cult glazing including him so idk a part of me thinks he&#x27;d still wanna be an idol too idk
gyuvin - well he can go ahead and debut in yuehuaz that&#x27;s really his dying wish but maybe he&#x27;ll try to pursue some flop acting maybe end up like younghoon
gunwook - goatie... i have a 10 year plan play book for his future he&#x27;s definitely going to be in a group and I have hope he&#x27;ll leave yuehua my ultimate dream is redebuting with yujin and matthew but I would wanna see him tapping into ultimate artistry and producing his own solo music YEZGAWD HENNEY
yujin - i think he has the most potential and debuting with yuehua is likely and a good choice for him uhmm maybe he&#x27;s even get bought out and do even better i think about his future the least tbh And in terms of management uh idk hopefully whatever they got is better than this and they can finally tap into things they&#x27;re all tailored to and get good promo like wow even for the members I don&#x27;t care ab lets shoot for better yall we don&#x27;t have to be popular just make good money and do things u like uhhh and promo that matches well wow this too damn long</p>
