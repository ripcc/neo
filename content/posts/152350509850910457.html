      <p>that one anon just projecting on tr and calling him bitter based on nothing like what 💀 you don&#x27;t know why tr and gv fought (and seeing how weirdly they acted in the past it&#x27;s not unlikely that the fight was caused by gv but whatever) you don&#x27;t know how bad it was and you don&#x27;t know why he didn&#x27;t give him a present so stop projecting lol if he thought he&#x27;s better than everyone else I&#x27;m sure he wouldn&#x27;t waste his time giving the younger members singing and guitar lessons and wouldn&#x27;t spend all of his time in the practicing room so he doesn&#x27;t hinder the other members in performances lol the whole &quot;cool, rational&quot; guy is so obviously just a front that he put on but that&#x27;s the thing he struggles to show affection and emotions easily and the members recognise that so obviously just take gunwook saying he hopes taerae let&#x27;s his walls down someday</p>
