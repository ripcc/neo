      <p>d&#x27;Angelo Wallace did a video on seunghan I didn&#x27;t realise how big it got even non kpopwfans seem to know about it...I wish the very racist anti Korean tweets getting over 100k likes would get this amount of coverage too</p>

      <p>bye I saw that I kinda wanna watch to see what he&#x27;ll say but I&#x27;ll get annoyed at how skewed everything is and exactly... this is why I hate this conversation THERE IS NO REAL PERSPECTIVEEEEEEE the surge of all those racist misogynistic tweets was crazy and nobody was batting an eye I felt so bad when I saw a bunch of Korean feminists making threads translating everything they were upset about but they got maybe 1/8th of the attention</p>
