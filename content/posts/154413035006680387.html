        <p>What would zb1 do without these two üò≠üò≠ Their content really fell off and you can notice Gunwook and Hb trying very hard to get the others to talk but the others literally dont give a fuck. Its all shortass answers. Yujin and Hao kill me with their constant ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢ faces /+r/153954640227162260</p>

      <p>honestly mv reactions are always boring to me no matter the group the only ones I‚Äôve found fun are the ones in this format where it‚Äôs the idol‚Äôs friends or coworkers reacting since they go in completely blind although this is easier for soloists to do than groups https://youtu.be/-hdmCbJ8ALU?si=MQn34n48HvRniZf _ /+r/154405888336288536</p>
