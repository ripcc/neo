      <p>I just want to say although I agree with you guys, I do hear him say 사람 없어. At least to me, the sound doesn’t match 옷 없어. Its too short and I don’t hear the T sound for “ot”. Do you guys think he possibly said 옷 사람없어? /+r/207de2fa42</p>

      <p>No that&#x27;s too long but it it sounds like 없다 not 없어 I kept rewatching the video and i can see both 옷 and 사람 but I don&#x27;t think the context changes either tho I think it&#x27;s closer to clothes I just started laughing seeing the Korean translation for what zeroses are going with cuz how the hell was Matthew gonna say all that😭</p>
