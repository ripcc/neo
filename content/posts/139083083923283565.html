        <p>I‚Äôm not sure what the yuehua asks are about but in regard to dispatch the only posted 8 members pics on Weibo but not Ricky which suprised me because the kr dispatch team seem to love Ricky like they always interact with him at the airport and make him the thumbnail so this did surprise me from their Weibo admin <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138960892950961624">/138960892950961624</a></p>

        <p>Basically saying that it could be yuehua but I don&#x27;t see why that would be the case either I find it absurd that they&#x27;d contact the dispatch team to leave him out. And like you said this wouldn&#x27;t happen on the Korean side so imo it&#x27;s completely on dispatch weibo not anything else</p>

      <p>i think its cause duhua was excluding ricky out from things whenever she talked about &quot;her&quot; achievements. i could be wrong tho üôè from what we know ricky is also never with the others when they go out and eat with the staff. ricky also seems to keep mostly to himself and not contact the evnne guys like gyuvin does, if ricky did we would hear about it from the evnne guys but they have almost never mentioned him during this one year... just very weird <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/139031033403366205">/139031033403366205</a></p>
