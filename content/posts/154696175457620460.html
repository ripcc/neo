      <p>I can’t see the previous ask but if it’s about hanbin didn’t randomly go out and hold two cups he was bringing the cups from inside to the table outside, I’m guessing no one else wanted to smell it and carry it out 😭 <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/154681348035140480" class="replyLink">/+r/154681348035140480</a></p>
