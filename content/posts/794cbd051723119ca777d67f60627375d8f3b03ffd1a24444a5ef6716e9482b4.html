      <p>The discussion about ssngs is making me curious bcs I feel like zeroses are especially very gossipy and obsessive so I wonder who between zb1 and riize have a bigger ssng issue (staffs that will spill easily and a very rich and obsessive cfanbase Vs average sm boygroup)</p>

      <p>I was about to head out but I gotta answer this so right before this seunghan stuff there was an account running through riize ssngs BAD ðŸ˜­ wakeone staff are way more tight lipped than sm staff cuz their manager actually got caught leaking their schedule to sasaengs ON THE AIRPLANE NNFNFNNDNMFMGMFM and some personal relationships with some as well. I think the levels of their ssngs are close I don&#x27;t wanna say zb1 fuel anything but compared to riize who don&#x27;t give reactions to anybody there&#x27;s less of a gain? so for them to be matched up and imo worse the riize ssngs got it sm is really the reigning champ. also since cssngs tend to be more open and crazed that just leads me to believe kssngs are smarter and more potent? and riize def have more of the latter</p>
