Honestly, this whole situation has me thinking a lot about Wakeone like so much people in the industry instantly backed MHJ and NJ, which suggests to me that some of this was already an open secret and I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if other companies advised their idols to be wary of idols, while Wakeone takes any chance to shit talk ZB1 unprompted lol even mocking them in a concert</p>
