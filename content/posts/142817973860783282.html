      <p>Something I wonder is after disbanding how active the boys will be ? Like obviously they back to being trainees so I don’t think some of them will have social media access again. For others it might be different. Like jiwoong will probably reopen his ig and other socials, hanbin’s company have let him have an ig pre debut too so they will let him be active and probably even get him pc or bbl, yuehuaz  probably won’t have any socials nor Taerae and then when they debut it will probably just be group socials but I wonder about Matthew and Gunwook. Anyway my guess is that post disbandment and before any of them redebut we will probably only get updates from hb and maybe jw. Possibly gw if he joins thel1ve then he’d get his own socials too.</p>
