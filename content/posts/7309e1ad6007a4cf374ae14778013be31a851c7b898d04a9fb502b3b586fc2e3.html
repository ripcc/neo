      <p>In my opinion its Yujin Ricky Zhanghao Gunwook Gyuvin Matthew Hanbin Jiwoong   Taerae Yujin ricky objectively handsome
Hao is prob my fave visual i really like his look
Gunwook consistently handsome
Gyuvin not my personal taste but i see it
Matthew is a cutie pie
Hanbin i never really found him attractive personally. He peaked last year, these days he looks scary
Uncle is meh but looks good every once in awhile
Taerae idk lmao</p>
