      <p>I think with Rk is that it&#x27;ll take longer for knets to openly support him/ stan him from past trauma of chinese idols ditching them to go back to China üßç I&#x27;m just saying it for what it is don&#x27;t come for me üò≠ So the fact that they&#x27;re already openly supporting him especially on theqoo of all places I think is a really positive thing <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/145688656756298316" class="replyLink">/+r/145688656756298316</a></p>
