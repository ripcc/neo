      <p>i think jiwoong will stay in wk1 after disbandment. imo among all the members, his agency is the easiest to break contract with. wk1 higher-ups obviously like him, the way they tried to protect him during shibalgate and the way his lines are increasing in every comeback. he will debut solo and follow the same path as yuri</p>
