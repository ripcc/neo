      <p>idk if it&#x27;s just bc i&#x27;m a psych major or wtv but it pisses me off so bad when people try to diagnose idols w mental disorders over a couple of quirky traits bc we literally Do Not know these people like that 🤦🏽‍♀️ plus having a favorite clothing brand is not an inherently autistic trait this anon sounds dumb asf 😭</p>
