      <p>He didnâ€™t say that ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it was an mca repo from a c fan and Iâ€™m pretty sure he was talking about his unit song because all the c fans are talking about it in the context of unit song and all he said was itâ€™s isnâ€™t his style (usual style) which after seeing the sampler I get . He was literally just on live saying he thinks fans are going to really like blue /+r/151375938305873348</p>
