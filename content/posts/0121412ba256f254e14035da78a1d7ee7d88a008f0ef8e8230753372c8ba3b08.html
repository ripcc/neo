      <p>why is it about the girls part? maybe it is just the type of people i grew up with, so it is just my personal observation. men are always more forgiving to their own kinds</p>

      <p>HVBNDNDMDMMDKD it caught me off guard maybe it is the people you know it&#x27;s true men are more forgiving to their own but just for my own experience I don&#x27;t see it that way</p>
