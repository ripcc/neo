      <p>They bowed to the person who photographed them so I doubt it was a fan let alone a fan request... Afaik fans cannot talk to idols at all in these types of events, they&#x27;re separated in different sections, at least the one time I went to a similar event for another idol I could see them for afar but definitely not interact with them lol I would get kicked out</p>
