      <p>honestly as someone who has spent her entire life on tumblr is the bestttt for anon questions. also there&#x27;s literally an archive so you can go there and it would organize your post by dates or tags. the only thing is that people are gonna be able to comment or repost your stuff but other than that its great, so much better than cc or ns and its really not that hard to navigate. you should really test it out and consider it.</p>

      <p>like damn if I like how the site looks I really might try it I know another move is annoying but I&#x27;d only do it if I thought it could be a permanent spot. I started building a profile already and I turned off replies to only people I follow so I could deal with it but yea I&#x27;ll have to see I&#x27;ll def consider it neospring isn&#x27;t bad I like it but if there&#x27;s better I wanna give it a chance. I do consider the people who lurk too and ik you have to have an acc to send stuff but I&#x27;ll poll it if it I think it&#x27;s set</p>
