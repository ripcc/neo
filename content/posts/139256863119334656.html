        <p>idc about the whole igot7 zerose fight but some zerose pick a fight with them saying hag7 cb flops and all when we‚Äôre likely gonna lose the music show wins to them we have no physical sales and can only rely on mv views digital streams and votes they seem to have good voting strategy so i really cant see us winning i know it‚Äôs just for pre-release but it will be embarrassing when we lose</p>

      <p>Theyve lost literally every single voting against us and just the fact that their big 10 year reunion cb will be struggling against a likkle pre-release with no physical points from a rookie group is already humiliating enough for them <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/139250110239560736">/139250110239560736</a></p>
