      <p>No her side acc is public lol people would have made an expose thread if that were true she&#x27;s a hao solo but she occasionally posts about other duos I would say she&#x27;s more of a yuehuaz fan and khaobinists and allins are angry because they feel like she doesn&#x27;t acknowledge hanbin. I just think it&#x27;s silly to police someone&#x27;s account to this extent iirc this is not the first time people have jumped her for cropping hanbin out which is normal for solo focused accounts and she does for other members too, she&#x27;s not hao&#x27;s biggest fanacc either and most of the people complaining are rps trolls who have many places they can look at for haobin material</p>
