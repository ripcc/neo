      <p>this could mean nothing since it was literally a video of hao so of course this is gonna happen but a few days back i was watching one of those fansign videos where you can hear fans yelling in the back for the idol to put on a costume or whatever and there were soooooooooo many yelling in chinese like yeah the chinese member is gonna have people talk in chinese to them ðŸ˜­ but idk i was still shocked, do we know how many chinese/foreign in general fans go to these fansigns? they must be keeping this shit afloat. i remember there was that controversy where an enhypen fansign had no korean fans that won, right? like do korean zeroses just not care to try to get into fansigns or are chinese/foreign fans buying more than them OR do they not even make THAT significant of a percentage like is it still more korean than foreign fans going to their fansigns?</p>

      <p>chn fans have always dominated the album game so they&#x27;re def overpowering at fansigns and fancalls it&#x27;s a staple in basically everyone group not just zbwon. for the fan cap they definitely have a limit on how many foreigners can join but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s almost purely cfans that get in for those ðŸ˜­</p>
