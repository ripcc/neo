      <p>Did both of them wearing it recently? Because the hanfu vs hanbok thing is a recent issue because both of them fighting who&#x27;s the original, like knetz will be mad if any korean member wear hanfu and vice versa, it&#x27;s the same situation with knetz will get angry if anyone mention chinese new year instead of lunar new year</p>
