      <p>https://x.com/irelydnwus/status/1878707200685936929?s=46 I understand they are frustrated but what do they want anyone to do. Unfortunately most events and concerts and shows will always be scheduled for the weekend because ultimately thatâ€™s always going to be when most people are free to attend so ofc itâ€™s going to impact how much he can mc is the group attends a lot of events</p>
