      <p>this is my take on hanbin&#x27;s peraonality, he is a people-pleaser, loves being appreciated, and most of the people around him actually like him. like just today there were two examples of miss gee and elle editor https://x.com/namubinn/status/1855531313991958962?s=19 https://x.com/blushiebin/status/1855509650483118506?s=19 don&#x27;t want to assume, but most probably he is queer and even accepted by his parents. so my own conclusion is that since he was liked and loved by most people when growing up so he has a hard time understanding why now people hate him that&#x27;s why he always has a reaction when he is getting extreme hate</p>
