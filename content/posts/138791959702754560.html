        <p>Yea I don&#x27;t think the songs as popular as yura yura but that&#x27;s decent enough and intl fans kinda sidelined it already since dcdcs coming out</p>

      <p>YuraYura did really well because not only was the song good, the part distribution was also good and some of the members went super viral when they were doing their Japanese variety promo so it brought in a lot of new people non bp related but Now or Never is just jzeroses. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/138493831334286103">/138493831334286103</a></p>
