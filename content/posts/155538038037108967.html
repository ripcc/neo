        <p>omfg pleaseeeee I hope kzeroses crash out more and will actually influence wk1 to change... I just want a tt in their range cause theyre right they sound so much better and have such pretty tonesssss but because the fucking songs are so high they have to do a bunch of shit layering and mixing and u cant even tell who tf is singing and uncs prob wont do that mickey mouse shit too that completely ruins their songs for me <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/155356893685177892" class="replyLink">/+r/155356893685177892</a></p>
