      <p>TikTok got me cracking up cuz why have I seen a Kamala and Seunghan edit (not shipping but like side by side) with the caption something like “they couldn’t handle us and let us down 😔” 😭 I also just saw a Joshua from Seventeen and Gavin Newsom edit talking about how fine California men are 😭</p>
