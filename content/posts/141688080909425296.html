        <p>I think only 4 members actually fw myungjae hb/yj/gv/gw (sorry queef 😭) but the difference between how they are in their own ot9 lives and this is obvious. I don’t think hao fws myungjae at all or Matthew, but then again like anon said since hanbin’s the closest to he kinda has to be that bridge <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/140941054282257555" class="replyLink">/+r/140941054282257555</a></p>
