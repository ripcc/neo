        <p>the likes to views ratio makes it even worse ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i didnt even realise that. other artists have 5k likes and around 20k views... 7k likes for 70k views is ðŸ’€ btw karinas fandoms known for buying views too <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/143260036951660712">/143260036951660712</a></p>

      <p>the views get updated on the site im using every hour. so when there is a unusual spike in numbers = bought it would for example go like this for fancams that have bought views: first hour: 5k 2nd hour: 3k 3rd hour: 1k 4th hour: 1.3k 5th hour: 1.2k and so on but if there is a 8th hour: 8k views or even a little more than 3k when its been stedily going 1-1.5k per hour its sus and means that from the 8k at least 7k were bought or from the 3k around 1k if you want to be generous. spikes can happen but for that the fancam would have to go viral for it to be real views <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/143273867748792326">/143273867748792326</a></p>
