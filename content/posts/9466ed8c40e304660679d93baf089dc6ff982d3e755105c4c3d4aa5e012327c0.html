      <p>you guys think that when we talk about non boring groups we talk about concepts? it&#x27;s about how fun they are at content- fan service. there was a time on where le sserafim had thousands of viral clips like that nepotism yunjin moment and one of the reasons why people shitted on IVE 24/7 was bc they compared them to Lesserafim who didn&#x27;t look awkward despite having members that were in other groups. Gidle always had their viral funny moments bc of Shuhua and Yuqi. And they were fun to see in variety shows. And well NMIXX has a viral funny clip of them every week.</p>
