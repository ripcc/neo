      <p>Whenever Ricky does lives and says stuff that is supposed to be flirty it makes me cringe so bad ðŸ˜¬ you can tell he donâ€™t even believe it and it feels like thereâ€™s a gun pointed to his head. He doesnâ€™t like going live and itâ€™s 100% clear but his delulu fans will swear wakeone doesnâ€™t allow him ever. Yeah the company is shitty and has actually done crappy things to him but lives is not one of them frfr</p>
