        <p>Gunwook and Jiwoong weren&#x27;t even a popular ship back in BP and they have even less chemistry now so why are they forcing this duo in Japan? Is it cause they&#x27;re the most fluent in Japanese? <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/145039568264191269">/145039568264191269</a></p>
