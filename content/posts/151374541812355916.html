        <p>speaking of yujin tho, he definitely invites it on himself, but the particular brand of babying that zeroses do w him is so funny to me when i take a step back and think...that is a whole 17 year old near 18 year old, he is a TEENAGER, nearly a YOUNG ADULT, i don&#x27;t buy the innocent act. i have a younger brother that age so i think the dissonance is especially real bc of that.</p>
