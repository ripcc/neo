      <p>CRis bought 30K followers for Hao&#x27;s ST for it to be restricted. Low visibility and won&#x27;t be on the trending Supertopic. CRosins are mad af because they&#x27;re promoting Madame Figaro there. It&#x27;s hard for them to reach more people when SUpertopic is restricted. Why would CRis do that when they&#x27;re selling different products?</p>
