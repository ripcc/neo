      <p>tinhatting here but i wonder if it’s a group of allins sending these anons bc u would think it’d be rosins but that’s too obvious?????? but then idk bc it’d make sense for the allins who sent those to get on their main and be like “free hanbin from haobinists and that ship” and there doesn’t seem to be any of that. my other theory was that it’s that one group of haobin related trolls (@/bigfujo, @/keehaogaysex, whatever other ones there are), like the ones who would spread hao’s predebut stuff and make crazy rumours</p>

      <p>uhm no not really this reads as typical rosin psychotics and allins havent really used this situation to make hit tweets an example of that would be when they used to use my cc as an example of hanbin hate and excuse to bully everyone it was crazy jfdfghfjdkfjghfdjs its obvious whoever is sending these threats is no more than 2 people spamming neosprings and retros im kinda crying cuz everyone gave them what they wanted.. attention😭</p>
