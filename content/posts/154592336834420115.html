      <p>Sorry someone just confirmed that itâ€™s not an extra degree but after his 3 years of dima he could have just finished but he chose to take an extra year at another university to turn his qualifications into a bachelors, we donâ€™t know for sure if this is what heâ€™s done but dima partners with alot of big unis in Seoul to allow this so if he passed with a high enough grade itâ€™s definitely a possibility. I still find it crazy heâ€™s chosen to do an extra year tho, I would have just dipped out if I was him. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/154586220524165327">/154586220524165327</a></p>
