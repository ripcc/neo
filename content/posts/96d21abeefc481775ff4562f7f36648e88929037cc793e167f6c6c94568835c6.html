      <p>anon..... why would you be humiliated at hanbin&#x27;s aotm being nominated for best choreography, it&#x27;s a good choreography? ðŸ˜­ like yeah zb1 has the mnet payola for nominations but that doesn&#x27;t mean a win. plus, do we even know what could be up for best choreography? like it might be actual released songs that are on streaming services bc there&#x27;s probably not much mnet related dance material outside of aotm and the street dancer shows AND it&#x27;s probably more for the choreographers rather than the idol, it&#x27;ll probably be like those awards that are &#x27;producer of the year&#x27; which not a single person gaf about. like u just wanted to hate on hanbin and u didn&#x27;t even do it in a more intelligent way like other anons i&#x27;m ctfu but yusssssss let&#x27;s get cinema paradise album of the year just because ðŸ˜›</p>
