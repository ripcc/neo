      <p>Taerae debuted in the wrong group lowkey. Idol singing doesn’t really suit his vocals so it’s probably strained now. He also doesn’t have much opportunities to stretch his voice like man in love so he probably just needs to practice more</p>

      <p>I used to really dislike taeraes tone I found it jarring but I feel like especially in zb1s songs he fits fine idk maybe it&#x27;s hearing him covering other people that makes it funny since he has a deeper dryer tone? Kinda like jaehyun but obv idol singing can often regress people since it&#x27;s stylistic? I&#x27;m guessing idk but I feel like he&#x27;s improved rather than get worse but I could be wrong I&#x27;m not the vocal professor</p>
