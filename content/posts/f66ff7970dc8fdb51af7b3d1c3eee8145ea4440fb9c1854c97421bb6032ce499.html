      <p>The way they made enhypen go viral and have that huge influx starting from douyin was so smart I think about it all the time when I see them trying to do it with other hybe groups like bnd but it isn&#x27;t working as well the next group to get the douyin hype actually looks like nct wish I&#x27;m jealousðŸ˜­ But we aren&#x27;t doing bad at all ngl zb1 is still definitely no1 for fifth gen groups in China</p>
