Ehhh not to be a party pooper but it&#x27;s probably fake ðŸ˜­ Not this anon by the way it&#x27;s just that everyone&#x27;s ex been blasted with no mercy face uncensored and everything so it&#x27;s just odd why they&#x27;d gatekeep Ricky&#x27;s especially since anon said that crosin is crazy so they would&#x27;ve exposed it by now. Even if it&#x27;s his friend they would&#x27;ve twist it into gf rumors by now</p>
