      <p>I heard this too. Apparently itâ€™s not about the lack of male trainees, like yes there is a decline but if 3 males survival shows running at the same time and all gather hundreds of trainees thereâ€™s no way bp2 wouldnâ€™t especially with seeing the success of zb1.
But like anon said they apparently are being super strict with who they take in which is why they donâ€™t have enough trainees yet tho I feel like they will take a lot from the survivals shows who just finished and made it to the finals but not debut <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/144294457452485124">/144294457452485124</a></p>

      <p>they&#x27;re definitely gonna start taking in the failed ss trainees now that most shows are over but yea I think they&#x27;re being strict because the trainee pool is what made bp blow up so they want it again + it&#x27;s mnet so their standards are higher</p>
