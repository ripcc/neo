        <p>Wow why do none of these people smile, my bias wasn’t even there and I thought it was a cute show. I also like that they got to meet another idol whose had a lot of experience, and idk jaejoong was super nice with them and idk much about him as an idol but I did read about his past with sm and I think he’s someone who’d make a good connection in terms of having dealt with a shitty company and not letting it end you <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/158744875507080439">/158744875507080439</a></p>
