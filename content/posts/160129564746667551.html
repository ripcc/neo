      <p>kind of yea its basically an insane code that grabs tickets at the speed of light and you pay proxies to get the tickets for you but its hard to find reliable ones since you gotta put ur trust in them and hand over ur info. but once youve found someone reliable its almost guaranteed you get a good ticket ik someone whos done it and always succeeds ðŸ˜­</p>
