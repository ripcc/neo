      <p>Jungkook went early bc he wanted to be at the same base as Jimin and spend his military service with him, that&#x27;s why he went early. The same way that Jaehyun went early bc he wanted to be a part of the military band so if he declined, he wouldn&#x27;t get the same chance ever again. HYBE sucks but only Jungkook akgaes want to believe that he went there early thanks to HYBE.</p>
