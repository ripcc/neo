      <p>No lmao we talked about it the day it happened and generally anime is full of unnecessary scenes but this one isn&#x27;t one of those the way it was framed in the tweets and post it looked like the female mc was assaulted right off the bat episode 1 but she ends up escaping before anything happens and it was basically the reason her powers awakened. it&#x27;s genuinely a really fun and interesting anime but I don&#x27;t blame anyone for not wanting to watch or shy away it&#x27;s to each their own but its not even close to being an anime that raises red flags</p>
