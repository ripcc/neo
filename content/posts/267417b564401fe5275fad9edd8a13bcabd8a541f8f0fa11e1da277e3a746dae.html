      <p>context , this is a lot less concrete and my own inference but you have almost all of it so i wouldnt say youre bad at telling but for gunwook im just basing it off of how closely i monitor him and different bits and pieces ive heard hes obviously going to date i never doubted that but i feel like i could tell when he started and when he broke up plus im affirming the broken up thing because its alleged again i never fully believe stuff i hear but my gunwook tweaker senses matched up with it so ill go with it</p>
