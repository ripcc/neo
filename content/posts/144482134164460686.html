        <p>i know people are gonna hate me for this but jw strikes me as prone to violence. we already knows he&#x27;s sleazy and shitty and uses the &quot;popular&quot; members for his own gains and doesn&#x27;t actually care about anybody but this clip <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/checkiam_/status/1885646056005976336"></a></blockquote> reminds me how on multiple occasions with multiple members, he&#x27;s been really rough. not to mention that one time he kicked gunwook so hard even hanbin was concerned as fuck.. LAWL. i need this man gone please</p>
