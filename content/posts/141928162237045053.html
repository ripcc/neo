      <p>The way people speak about itzy has to be studied because it’s just so much disassociation and coping. Let’s be 100% honest, the group just started releasing not that great music, their vocal tones sound like screeching when they try to reach high notes (especially Yeji), and none of them have like super super unique talents. They lost their relevancy and I doubt they’ll ever regain their popularity. If they were any other group under a non-big 4 company no one would be talking about them. And like it’s really odd because the fans they have left swear on their momma the music is good and that it’s all lies, like let’s take a step back and gauge the audience. The music is mid, and even when they were “good” they were copying early Weki Meki. Itzy did fall off. And Ryujin isn’t an actual lesbian and is busy dating annoyying ass Haechan.</p>

      <p>Omg thank you people are always like what happenedddddd WE ALL SAW HELLO 😭??? Their downfall started at the wave of new ggs that captured attention domestically and internationally they stood no chance against that. because they debuted in 2019 they&#x27;re treated as way older than the other ggs too everything just started at a bad time and their peak was 2019-2021 like that ittttt. I&#x27;m positive haechan and ryujin broke up they were together for a whileee despite how crazy they were</p>
