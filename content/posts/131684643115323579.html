      <p>I was so confused I mean why were they talking about me in the first place &amp; it wasn&#x27;t even the person I knew who told them I did crack they just assumed I did because I was on their ig ðŸ˜­ &amp; the funniest thing is the picture had no indication of crack or even alcohol it was just a normal group picture.... I never even been to that town other than that one time for my volley ball tournament but my reputation is already ruined there ðŸ˜­ /+r/1309068303</p>
