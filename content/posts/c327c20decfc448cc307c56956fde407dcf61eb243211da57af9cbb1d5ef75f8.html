      <p>Gunwook needs to brush up his PR skill and needs to learn it from Hanbin Hyung. Literally everyone, including Koreans, were extremely sympathetic towards him after the strawberry nuisance. I don&#x27;t even called it an incident; everyone was calling him talented and feeling bad for him. If he had done some fake apology like he was on dieting and felt hungry, so that&#x27;s why I ate barely 40 calories of strawberry, and he apologized for that. He would have gotten even more empathy and support from non-Zeros.</p>

      <p>are you crazy gunwook wouldve got lit up for that... he got sympathy but the hate was almost equal to that and the strawberry scandal still follows him gunwooks in an unfortunate unique situation his issues are magnified to the thousandth power no matter what he does and the only time i feel like the sympathy outweighed a considerable amount was isac if he addresses anything directly hes basically asking to get more hate he doesnt get to brush it off like everyone else</p>
