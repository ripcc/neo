      <p>Wjsn used to be a joint collab btw yuehua and starship, so i can see duhua agreeing to extend zb1&#x27;s contract/keep them permanent if CJ allows zb1 to be comanaged by yuehua. They&#x27;d be able to get a higher profit of zb1&#x27;s activities and brag about having a top bg in their company (for the first time in their life). I wouldn&#x27;t mind this option tbh and i could see it working.</p>

      <p>This honestly isn&#x27;t a bad idea it has its own problems but if money truly is what the companies are after they should know the extensions the best shot it doesn&#x27;t even have to extend to fill the average 7 year duration I&#x27;ll live with 2 years extra. dangggggg we&#x27;re gonna be losing our minds when 2025 comes to an end</p>
