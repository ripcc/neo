        <p>Their title tracks parts are predetermined by the company regardless of the producer tho i think the members mentioned that already <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/147008105899842518" class="replyLink">/+r/147008105899842518</a></p>

      <p>yea they would most likely just copy how the demo is sung made by kenzie but the parts/lines distrib are what is predetermined by the company <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/147010434124437733" class="replyLink">/+r/147010434124437733</a></p>
