      <p>I don’t wanna be too depressing but with the new year coming up I realise we fr might only have one year with them left like the extension is a massive IF atm and it’s looking less likely than likely. I hope that this final year is amazing and prosperous for them like idk what they will do after zb1 and most likely none of it will be as big as what they do in the group so I just really hope that in this final year they have everything</p>
