      <p>hanbin also has a shorter torso so everything in that region is more compact and can push his bulge forward which then can appear bigger but its just cause his guts are in the way and have no where else to go like theres high and low dick placements from body structure, some dicks are higher up and some dicks are more lower kinda tucked between the thigh which makes it appear smaller but they can have the biggest dingdongs</p>
