      <p>i don&#x27;t get ppl who talk about waiting for disbandment like why not just leave now if u don&#x27;t like it, u don&#x27;t gotta see it through ðŸ˜­ not really related but it&#x27;s actually funnier when it&#x27;s akgaes counting down to disbandment day bc every survival show group idol obv loses a ton of fans when they disband and i feel like lots of them are just akgaes who were only here for the competition aspect yet were complaining about said idol being part of a group in the first place. idk if this has ever been proven but it seems like a thing that&#x27;d happen to me /+r/54d4cdde1e</p>
