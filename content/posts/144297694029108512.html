        <p>the way people are already moving on to smnbgâ€¦i wonder if itâ€™s going to affect riice ðŸ¤” the way they are promoting the rookies reminds me of smrookie program they had for nct just casually revealing their huge male rookie roster while also giving people content</p>

      <p>I&#x27;m personally a little too old to still be hype about new kpop kids but as an ex nctzen turned zerose who was excited for riize and god let down (remember when they were introduced as a nostalgic pop whatever sound lmfaoooo) i do have expectations for smnbg but again bc nct&#x27;s peak was amazing music and variety content wise i miss it sometimes /+r/144295717165554530</p>

      <p>ur never too old but i get it lol. i honestly was fully ready to tolerate riice part time in aug 2023 but everything after was just booboo and i put the kings first. but i agree to me nct was the last great bg its just never getting gaggy and fun like that again im glad i was there to witness their peak (before 2021) neo2019 i think ab u everydayyy</p>
