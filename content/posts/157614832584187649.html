        <p>anon probably means that if yuehua is making tempest release chinese versions of their songs, they&#x27;ll probably make yuehuaz (if they redebut together) do the same and promote them more in china as a group. they already have members who are popular in china and if the rumors about china lifting the kpop ban are true, then yuehua will def milk all of them for all they&#x27;re worth in china as well and won&#x27;t have to limit themselves to promoting the chinese members only. /+r/157515850977599105</p>

      <p>True but ig it depends how the idol market shifts because itâ€™s not exactly booming there the same way it is in the k market so unless yh makes some of them go into acting or a lot of variety idk how that will work out for them /+r/157526758600692617</p>
