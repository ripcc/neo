        <p>omg he was sooo fricking doll faced today we had to stream that fancam 4000 times and it&#x27;s confirmed he had that love eternally line so im happy ab that too. I rlly liked Ricky and Matthew&#x27;s too I already forgot what half the group was wearing so I can&#x27;t rmbr yjns but the fits weren&#x27;t too bad with the stage it looked more jarring in the mcountdown video. I&#x27;m just wondering if this has a choreo or not I was watching the fancam and I could see gwk dancing but maybe it&#x27;s not to the full song idk</p>
