      <p>speaking of them: i saw baemon live and up close and immediately fell in love with ahyeon and asa. like i never once in a million years thought id be a fan of baemon out of all groups but seeing them live really makes you ignore how mid the studio versions of their songs are. also theyâ€™re so young im pretty sure ahyeon is 3rd oldest at 17 and youngest chiquita is 15 so i can ignore the dramatics because its clear that they love the stage a lot to be doing all that. asa is the best performer in the group by far but all the girls are talented as fuck. <a href="https://ripcc.github.io/neo/posts/143505948043075209">/143505948043075209</a></p>
