      <p>i feel like yh wants hao to be in gucci bc yibo is already with loewe. they can&#x27;t put yibo in gucci bc his biggest competitor which is xiao zhan is already gucci&#x27;s global ambassador. they have more freedom with hao bc he&#x27;s still a rookie and mainly promotes in korea. it kinda makes me think that the custom piece suit of xiao zhan and hao being identical was intentional too. i think they will push him to be on xiao zhan&#x27;s level</p>
