        <p>I was checking h2h and zb1 yt mv views, and noticed they have 230k likes and we only have 81k likes despite our views being 2 times higher(probably because of ads). How is a rookie gg able to do this number just because they are a big4 girl group or are zeroses that bad at streaming</p>

        <p>you&#x27;re truly underestimating how much impact big4 has ESPECIALLY FROM SEASIA ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ there&#x27;s a difference from streaming and passerby views as well you can only like once per account. obv there&#x27;s ad help but the disparity is largely due to the fresh novelty of a new big4 group that debuted an Indonesian. also I&#x27;m pretty sure you can buy likes no?</p>
