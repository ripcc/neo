      <p>see? This is why giving him this much endorsement deals in CHINA won&#x27;t help with his Kpop idol career in KOREA. He wants to be a Kpop idol and ZB1 is supposed to be a Kpop group being promoted in Korea but even Gyuvin &amp; Matthew who are khias in Korea compared are being pushed more than Hao. But Zeroses will always say that Hao is being promoted with his 15839 brand deals in China</p>
