        <p>i think its hao too but thats cause he has the biggest fandom so wide range of fans but imo its not gonna hit him as much as ricky and hanbin who&#x27;s half the fandom is consist of only that and tbh if hao stays with yuehua they are just gonna find another target ðŸ˜­ /+r/160847502227234609</p>

        <p>imo haos fandom is similar as well he has the larger fandom so automatically larger influx of fans who participate for the rage but its rlly not a huge proportional difference. cuz no shade rosinism has been built on schizobabble just as much as allinsim and riyangism if not more ðŸ˜­ hell retain a lot of those fans if he redebuts in yh quick enough but that could be more negative than losing them</p>

      <p>Anon you are in for a big suprise if you don&#x27;t think that Haos fandom isn&#x27;t filled with akgaes ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ He has more akgae fans. You can notice who is what type of a fan by what they post about when mentioning Hao or who they or their moots follow. Its also very known that most Haobinists are Hao biased. What do you think will happen to these people once they have no ship to fangirl about? Most of them will find a new ship to obsess over. Thats just the circle of Kpop /+r/161008309334398618</p>
