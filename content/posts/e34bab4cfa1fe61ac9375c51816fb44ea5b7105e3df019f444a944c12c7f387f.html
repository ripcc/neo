      <p>Hanbin - vaped once w his friends but that was it
Jiwoong - uncle loves his banana berry apple pie blitz pod that comes with led lights and can make callsüòç
Hao - maybe one of those cute ones Yknow the kinda blinged out ones
Matthew - owns a vape
Taerae - I can‚Äôt see him vaping
Ricky - he owns one but he isn‚Äôt crazy addicted
Gyuvin - I know he says he‚Äôs super anti smoker so I think he‚Äôs either always hitting one or he gives a whole ass lecture to whoever he sees holding one there‚Äôs no in between
Gunwook - I can‚Äôt see him vaping either ngl I feel like he‚Äôd worry about the health aspect of it
Yujin - yeah</p>

      <p>NDNNFJFJDMFMMDMFKFKFN WHY DID THE JIWOONG ONE JUST MAKE ME LAUGH SO BAD that&#x27;s a good one
I think Matthew probably vaped a bunch in highschool and his first year in korea but he seems like with his gym journey he probably full stopped don&#x27;t think he was ever heavy
Gyuvin is those people sooooo against drinking and smoking but he&#x27;ll vape like this guy probably don&#x27;t play about his pingdu vape
I agree w everything else</p>
