      <p>Biggest to least cheater vibes in my opinion Jiwoong: Heavy cheater vibes not even being biased against him I just think he gives that vibe lol like he would never break up but constantly cheat no remorse Gunwook: ok don&#x27;t get mad req...I think he&#x27;s the type to not view sex as a super emotional thing like if the opportunity arises he&#x27;ll take it, he has a promiscuous vibe he&#x27;ll stand by his partner and will not willingly leave them himself tho like for him these are completely different things Ok now I&#x27;d place most of them at the same level tbh but 3/4. Yujin/Ricky I feel like they&#x27;re the type to text like 50 girls at the same time for gunwook and jiwoong I can see them comit hard but have occasional side relationships for fun while for Ricky and Yujin I think they&#x27;re more casual in general  I cannot see them solely entertaining one person for years Hao seems sensitive so could cheat emotionally, like when his relationship is going through it he&#x27;ll emotional cheat for approval and them stop when it gets better, I put him at #3 at first but I think he&#x27;s less likely to physically cheat (although he does also give big hoe vibes too so idk could be top 3), loyal but not faithful vibes if that makes sense Hanbin he&#x27;s a mystery but he does give major hoe vibes to me I feel like he&#x27;d physically cheat maybe once or twice but not emotionally and he&#x27;ll regret it after, also think he&#x27;s the type to stay even if his partner did him dirty so also loyal but not faithful vibes Taerae no thoughts on Taerae think he could also do it fro approval but idk he gives no vibes to me Gyuvin wouldn&#x27;t I think or would impulsively and  then have a massive mental breakdown after because he&#x27;d regret it really hard due to his morals Matthew wouldn&#x27;t I think</p>
