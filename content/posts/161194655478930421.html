        <p><a href="http://xhslink.com/a/1LVJ1ebCQFc8">http://xhslink.com/a/1LVJ1ebCQFc8</a> This is interesting it&#x27;s how some people buy fancall spots from proxies I would have never guessed that eunseok has the most expensive calls in riizeðŸ¤” Maybe this was just for one call because I can&#x27;t see wonbin not being first. Jisung for nct dream and soobin for txt being highest are also actually different from what I expected too I thought it would be one of mark/haechan and yeonjun. Also zb1 are so expensive for a 5th gen group?? We&#x27;re basically matching nct dream</p>

      <p>If this is based on chinese popularity, it makes sense. <a href="https://reqarchive.github.io/neo/posts/161001386673397674" class="replyLink">/+r/161001386673397674</a></p>

      <p>I&#x27;m assuming it is but that&#x27;s what&#x27;s surprising, I thought wonbin was more popular than eunseok like.. everywhere ðŸ˜­</p>
