        <p>Right because he would totally say all of that to his fans who are mostly gf stans 😭😭 idk why are shippers so obsessed with making the members look like they hate their gf stans (ik this is a shipper because they&#x27;re saying the same thing on shipper ns lmaooo) it&#x27;s what his gf cfans say to him like &quot;i&#x27;ll be your dog/ i want to be your dog&quot; in the sense of being loyal to someone or when they&#x27;re thirsting over him like let&#x27;s be serious plqhdhjekz /+r/144110936498852899</p>

        <p>Yea sorry that makes 0 sense that is literally majority of his fandom why would he say that 😭 I didn&#x27;t know the connotation but still it didn&#x27;t make sense why would he dog on his fans</p>

      <p>About the gf Stans dog thing don’t take it too serious. He could have meant it multiple ways… the only thing I do know is that he did translate “I’m Haos gf” to “I’m Haos dog” in Chinese..: take that as you will ig /+r/144119247042468011</p>
