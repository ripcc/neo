      <p>first they said it was another woman then they say it&#x27;s an a-lister and now it&#x27;s choi hyunwook 😭 I feel like people are just spreading rumors because he&#x27;s under that company and is getting popular. they were really close and he even attended her funeral /+r/158266246431986484</p>

      <p>yea I thought the extra person was an A-lister who came out unscathed and choi hyunwook definitely isn&#x27;t a top actor 😭 I don&#x27;t believe it</p>
