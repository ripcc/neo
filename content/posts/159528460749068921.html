        <p>List of wonyoung x ricky thingys so far (tinhatting) both 04 liners wonyoung referencing ricky’s catchphrase “young and rich, tall and handsome” replacing the “handsome” with “beautiful” wore the same tie ricky doing wonyoung’s panaroma dance gyuvin calling ricky lucky vicky both resemble junji ito characters i remember one of your anons saying that gaeul quoted one of ricky’s lines as well to wonyoung and she started laughing also from another anon during AAA rehearsal where maybe wonyoung (mc) asked something and ricky was trying to respond but his mic wasn’t working so he looked stupid 😭 wonyoung’s type being “ the looks of a blunt wolf rather than a puppy, someone who takes care of themselves, reliable, easygoing only with her and she doesn’t like people who get sulky easily and don’t communicate” <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/ivepics_/status/1900114129354191027?s=46&amp;t=DN30ilKIcVo36LJdG9cE-w"></a></blockquote> this wonyoung selfie giving major ricky vibes too he takes selfies with this angle all the time both post bathrobe pictures in expensive hotels and they both have luxurious, flashy vibes and branding both have lived in america and are eng speakers and have very similar eng names lmfao i remember seeing a viral kr tweet about them as well but i don’t remember its an intl fan doing the same meme of kyungsoo and tzuyu but with wonyoung and ricky and a korean qrt went viral both dislike mbti and have voiced their disdain for being put into a box and a personality type (which is cool considering how mbti is huge in korea to the point where you have out your mbti on your resume) both associated with strawberries both known for their style esp their airport looks both have a mole under their right eye</p>
