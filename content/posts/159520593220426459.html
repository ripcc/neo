        <p>idk how it works in korea but he&#x27;s not getting a bachelors IN psychology he&#x27;s completing a 4 yr program with 3 yrs of that media degree and 1 yr of psychology. If he weren&#x27;t an idol he could probably get some internships maybe entry level psychology related jobs w that but nothing crazy</p>
