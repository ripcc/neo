        <p>ngl i think haobin actually dance well together their tutting bit and dance breaks are totally in sync and they have a similar build so ig that helps too? like i would be down bad to see them dance together more if they akgaes wouldnâ€™t mass crash out /+r/131779097193042827</p>

      <p>i feel like in terms of dance partners, I see haobin, mattrikwook and gyujin as the most complementary for each other. don&#x27;t really have a strong opinion for tr or unc tbh but it really amazes me how different everyone&#x27;s dance styles are like I think haobin are more precise/technical dancers (hb strengths being ofc tutting/waacking and hao excels in more elegant, almost ballet-like dancing, probably from having gg dancing foundation); mattrikwook excel in more groovy, sorta old school hip hop but also dances that require more power/strength; gyujin are sorta the quintessential 4th gen bg style dancers - the boyz type choreos suit them. would love to see more of these combos https://neospring.org/+r/131783650131006301</p>
