        <p>The live is so meh it&#x27;s too dark and looks like their earphone is not working well for some members especially yujin&#x27;s, they announced the live days before today so I thought they prepared everything well but..........ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

      <p>They were just talking and playing games but since there&#x27;s a problem with the earphone (for translation) there&#x27;s some silent moments that make the live awkward
